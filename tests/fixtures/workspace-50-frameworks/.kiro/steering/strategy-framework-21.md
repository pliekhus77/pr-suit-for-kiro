## Purpose

This is test framework 21 for workspace fixture testing. It provides guidance on implementing features using Framework 21 best practices.

**NOTE: This document has been customized by the team.**


## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Core Principle

Framework 21 emphasizes the following core principle: Always follow best practices and maintain code quality.

**Example:**
```typescript
function example20() {
  // Implementation for framework 21
  return {
    id: 21,
    name: 'Framework 21',
    version: '1.2.0'
  };
}
```

### Concept 2: Implementation Pattern

Use the following pattern when implementing features with Framework 21:

1. Define requirements
2. Design solution
3. Implement with tests
4. Deploy and monitor

## Best Practices

1. **Practice 1**: Always validate inputs
2. **Practice 2**: Use dependency injection
3. **Practice 3**: Write comprehensive tests
4. **Practice 4**: Document your code
5. **Practice 5**: Follow naming conventions

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Skipping Tests

Don't skip writing tests. Tests are essential for maintaining code quality.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Hardcoding Values

Avoid hardcoding configuration values. Use configuration files or environment variables.

## Summary

Framework 21 provides a structured approach to software development. Follow the key concepts and best practices outlined in this document to ensure high-quality implementations.
