# File Integrity Tests Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive file integrity tests have been implemented to verify framework content integrity, metadata corruption detection/recovery, partial file write recovery, and atomic operation guarantees.

## Test File Location
`tests/security/file-integrity.test.ts`

## Test Coverage

### 1. Framework Content Integrity After Installation (6 tests)
Tests that verify framework content remains intact during and after installation:

- **Content integrity verification**: Verifies framework content matches source after installation using SHA-256 hash comparison
- **Corruption detection**: Detects content corruption during installation by comparing hashes
- **Update integrity**: Verifies content integrity after framework updates
- **Binary content preservation**: Ensures binary-like content (with null bytes) is preserved correctly
- **Large file integrity**: Tests integrity verification for large files (1MB) with performance checks (<2s)

### 2. Metadata Corruption Detection and Recovery (7 tests)
Tests that ensure metadata integrity and recovery mechanisms:

- **Corrupted JSON detection**: Detects truncated or malformed JSON in metadata files
- **Metadata recreation**: Recovers from corrupted metadata by recreating it
- **Invalid schema detection**: Handles metadata with missing required fields
- **Type mismatch handling**: Handles metadata with wrong data types (string vs number, etc.)
- **Circular reference recovery**: Handles metadata with circular references
- **Write validation**: Validates metadata after write operations
- **Concurrent corruption**: Handles concurrent metadata corruption scenarios

### 3. Partial File Write Recovery (6 tests)
Tests that ensure recovery from partial or interrupted file writes:

- **Partial write detection**: Detects when file writes are interrupted mid-operation
- **Cleanup after failure**: Ensures no partial files remain after failed writes
- **Interrupted updates**: Handles interrupted writes during framework updates
- **Partial metadata recovery**: Recovers from partial metadata writes
- **Temporary file usage**: Verifies use of temporary files for atomic writes
- **Disk full handling**: Handles ENOSPC (disk full) errors gracefully

### 4. Atomic Operation Guarantees (8 tests)
Tests that ensure all-or-nothing operations and consistency:

- **All-or-nothing installation**: Ensures installation is atomic (complete or rolled back)
- **Rollback on failure**: Verifies rollback mechanisms when installation fails
- **Atomic metadata updates**: Ensures metadata updates are atomic
- **Race condition prevention**: Prevents race conditions during concurrent installations
- **Update consistency**: Maintains consistency during update failures
- **Atomic copy operations**: Verifies copy operations are atomic
- **System crash handling**: Handles system crashes during operations
- **Concurrent operation handling**: Manages concurrent framework installations

## Key Testing Patterns

### Hash-Based Integrity Verification
```typescript
const contentHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(originalContent).digest('hex');
const writtenHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(writtenContent).digest('hex');
expect(writtenHash).toBe(contentHash);
```

### Corruption Simulation
```typescript
mockFileSystem.readFile.mockImplementation(async (filePath: string) => {
  if (filePath.includes('test.md')) {
    return originalContent + '\n<!-- CORRUPTED -->';
  }
});
```

### Partial Write Simulation
```typescript
let writeAttempts = 0;
mockFileSystem.writeFile.mockImplementation(async (filePath: string) => {
  writeAttempts++;
  if (writeAttempts === 1 && filePath.includes('test.md')) {
    throw new Error('Disk full - partial write');
  }
});
```

### Atomic Operation Testing
```typescript
let frameworkWritten = false;
let metadataWritten = false;

mockFileSystem.writeFile.mockImplementation(async (filePath: string) => {
  if (filePath.includes('test.md')) {
    frameworkWritten = true;
    throw new Error('Metadata write failed');
  }
  if (filePath.includes('installed-frameworks.json')) {
    metadataWritten = true;
  }
});
```

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 (Framework Installation)
- ✅ Content integrity verified after installation
- ✅ Corruption detection during installation
- ✅ Binary content preservation
- ✅ Large file handling with performance checks

### Requirement 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (Framework Updates)
- ✅ Update integrity verification
- ✅ Metadata corruption detection and recovery
- ✅ Partial write recovery
- ✅ Atomic operation guarantees
- ✅ Rollback on failure
- ✅ Consistency during update failures

## Error Scenarios Tested

1. **File System Errors**
   - Disk full (ENOSPC)
   - Process interruption (EPIPE)
   - Concurrent modifications
   - System crashes

2. **Data Corruption**
   - Truncated JSON
   - Invalid schema
   - Type mismatches
   - Circular references
   - Binary data corruption

3. **Partial Operations**
   - Interrupted writes
   - Failed metadata updates
   - Incomplete installations
   - Race conditions

4. **Atomicity Violations**
   - Framework written but metadata failed
   - Concurrent installations
   - Update failures mid-operation

## Performance Considerations

- Large file (1MB) integrity checks complete in <2 seconds
- Concurrent operation handling with simulated delays
- Hash-based verification for efficient integrity checks

## Security Implications

These tests ensure:
- No partial or corrupted files remain after failures
- Metadata integrity is maintained
- Atomic operations prevent inconsistent states
- System can recover from various failure scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. **Checksum Files**: Store checksums alongside installed frameworks for verification
2. **Transaction Logs**: Implement transaction logs for better rollback capabilities
3. **Backup Verification**: Verify backup integrity before updates
4. **Incremental Verification**: Periodic integrity checks of installed frameworks
5. **Repair Mechanisms**: Automatic repair of corrupted frameworks

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all file integrity tests
npm test -- tests/security/file-integrity.test.ts

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- tests/security/file-integrity.test.ts -t "Framework Content Integrity"
npm test -- tests/security/file-integrity.test.ts -t "Metadata Corruption"
npm test -- tests/security/file-integrity.test.ts -t "Partial File Write"
npm test -- tests/security/file-integrity.test.ts -t "Atomic Operation"
```

## Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 27
- **Test Categories**: 4
- **Requirements Covered**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
- **Error Scenarios**: 15+
- **Performance Tests**: 2

## Conclusion

The file integrity tests provide comprehensive coverage of:
1. Content integrity verification using cryptographic hashes
2. Metadata corruption detection and recovery mechanisms
3. Partial file write recovery and cleanup
4. Atomic operation guarantees and rollback capabilities

These tests ensure the framework management system maintains data integrity even in the face of system failures, corruption, or concurrent operations.
