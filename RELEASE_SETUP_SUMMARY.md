# 🚀 CI/CD Release Setup Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Complete Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
A comprehensive workflow that handles the entire release process:

- ✅ **Tag Validation** - Ensures semantic versioning format
- 🏗️ **Build & Test** - Full quality gates (compile, lint, test, coverage ≥80%)
- 📦 **VSIX Packaging** - Creates extension package with validation
- 🚀 **GitHub Release** - Creates release with VSIX attachment
- 🌐 **Marketplace Publishing** - Optionally publishes to VS Code Marketplace
- 📊 **Metrics & Notifications** - Tracks deployment metrics and sends notifications

### 2. Release Helper Script (`scripts/create-release.js`)
Automated release creation with validation:

```bash
# Quick releases
npm run release:patch  # 1.2.3 → 1.2.4
npm run release:minor  # 1.2.3 → 1.3.0  
npm run release:major  # 1.2.3 → 2.0.0

# Custom versions
npm run release 1.2.3-beta.1
```

**Features:**
- Git state validation (clean working directory)
- Automated testing and coverage checks
- Version updates in package.json
- Git tag creation and pushing
- Clear next-steps guidance

### 3. Enhanced Package.json Scripts
New npm scripts for release management:

```json
{
  "release": "node scripts/create-release.js",
  "release:patch": "node scripts/create-release.js patch",
  "release:minor": "node scripts/create-release.js minor", 
  "release:major": "node scripts/create-release.js major",
  "package:vsix:version": "vsce package --out pragmatic-rhino-suit-$(node -p \"require('./package.json').version\").vsix",
  "publish:vsix": "vsce publish --packagePath"
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- 📖 **Release Process Guide** (`docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`) - Complete release documentation
- 📋 **Workflow README** (`.github/workflows/README.md`) - Updated with new release process
- 🎯 **This Summary** - Quick reference for the new setup

## How It Works

### Automated Release Flow
```
1. Developer runs: npm run release:patch
   ├── Validates git state
   ├── Runs tests & coverage checks  
   ├── Updates package.json version
   ├── Creates & pushes git tag
   └── Shows next steps

2. GitHub Actions (release.yml) automatically:
   ├── Validates tag format
   ├── Builds & tests extension
   ├── Creates VSIX package
   ├── Creates GitHub release
   ├── Attaches VSIX to release
   └── Publishes to marketplace (if configured)
```

### Release Types

**Stable Releases:**
- Tag format: `v1.2.3`
- Creates public GitHub release
- Publishes to VS Code Marketplace (if VSCE_PAT configured)

**Pre-releases:**
- Tag format: `v1.2.3-beta.1`, `v1.2.3-alpha.1`, `v1.2.3-rc.1`
- Creates GitHub pre-release
- Does NOT publish to marketplace
- Perfect for testing

## Installation Options

### From GitHub Releases (Always Available)
Every release creates a downloadable VSIX file:

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/pliekhus77/pr-suit-for-kiro/releases)
2. Download `pragmatic-rhino-suit-X.X.X.vsix`
3. Install: `code --install-extension pragmatic-rhino-suit-X.X.X.vsix`

### From VS Code Marketplace (If Published)
For stable releases with VSCE_PAT configured:

1. Search "Pragmatic Rhino SUIT" in VS Code Extensions
2. Or: `code --install-extension pragmatic-rhino.pragmatic-rhino-suit`

## Configuration Requirements

### Required (Already Set Up)
- ✅ GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- ✅ Release workflow file created
- ✅ Helper scripts implemented
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Optional (For Marketplace Publishing)
- ⚠️ **VSCE_PAT Secret** - VS Code Marketplace Personal Access Token

#### Setting up VSCE_PAT:
1. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Create Personal Access Token with **Marketplace (Publish)** scope
3. Add to GitHub repository secrets as `VSCE_PAT`
4. Future releases will automatically publish to marketplace

## Quick Start

### Create Your First Release

1. **Ensure everything is ready:**
   ```bash
   npm test              # All tests pass
   npm run lint          # No linting errors
   git status            # Clean working directory
   ```

2. **Create release:**
   ```bash
   npm run release:patch
   ```

3. **Monitor progress:**
   - GitHub Actions: https://github.com/pliekhus77/pr-suit-for-kiro/actions
   - Releases: https://github.com/pliekhus77/pr-suit-for-kiro/releases

### Test with Pre-release

For testing, create a pre-release first:

```bash
npm run release 0.2.3-beta.1
```

This creates a GitHub pre-release without publishing to marketplace.

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Success Indicators
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
- ✅ GitHub release created with VSIX attachment
- ✅ Extension installable from downloaded VSIX
- ✅ (Optional) Extension visible on VS Code Marketplace

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Invalid tag format" error:**
- Ensure using `v` prefix: `v1.2.3` not `1.2.3`

**"Coverage below threshold" error:**
- Add tests to reach 80% coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

**"Uncommitted changes" error:**
- Commit or stash changes: `git status`

**Marketplace publishing failed:**
- Check if VSCE_PAT secret is configured
- Verify token has correct permissions
- Check if version already exists on marketplace

### Getting Help
1. Check [Release Process Guide](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md)
2. Review [Workflow Documentation](.github/workflows/README.md)
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
4. Create issue with workflow run details

## Next Steps

1. **Test the setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run release 0.2.3-test.1
   ```

2. **Configure marketplace publishing (optional):**
   - Set up VSCE_PAT secret for automatic marketplace publishing

3. **Create your first stable release:**
   ```bash
   npm run release:patch
   ```

4. **Monitor and iterate:**
   - Watch first few releases to ensure everything works
   - Adjust process based on team feedback
