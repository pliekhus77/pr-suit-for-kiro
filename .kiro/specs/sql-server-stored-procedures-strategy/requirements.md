# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive SQL Server Stored Procedures strategy documentation to the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT framework collection. The goal is to provide developers with best practices, patterns, and guidance for designing, implementing, and maintaining stored procedures in SQL Server environments. This includes creating both a detailed framework reference document and a compact strategy guide for quick reference within the VS Code extension.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create Detailed Framework Reference Document

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive SQL Server stored procedures framework document, so that I can understand best practices, patterns, and implementation strategies for database logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the framework document THEN it SHALL be placed in `frameworks/sql-server-stored-procedures.md`
2. WHEN the document is created THEN it SHALL include sections on overview, key concepts, best practices, implementation patterns, security considerations, performance optimization, testing strategies, and error handling
3. WHEN the document is created THEN it SHALL include code examples demonstrating proper stored procedure patterns
4. WHEN the document is created THEN it SHALL address transaction management, parameter handling, and result set patterns
5. WHEN the document is created THEN it SHALL include guidance on when to use stored procedures versus other approaches

### Requirement 2: Update Framework Inventory

**User Story:** As a developer browsing available frameworks, I want the SQL Server stored procedures framework listed in the inventory, so that I can discover and access this resource.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework document is created THEN the `frameworks/INVENTORY.md` file SHALL be updated
2. WHEN updating the inventory THEN the entry SHALL be added under the "Databases & Data Storage" section
3. WHEN updating the inventory THEN the entry SHALL follow the existing format and naming conventions
4. WHEN updating the inventory THEN it SHALL include a brief description of the framework's purpose

### Requirement 3: Create Compact Strategy Guide

**User Story:** As a developer using the VS Code extension, I want a compact strategy guide for SQL Server stored procedures, so that I can quickly reference key patterns and decisions during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the strategy guide THEN it SHALL be placed in `resources/frameworks/strategy-sql-server-sp.md`
2. WHEN the strategy guide is created THEN it SHALL follow the same format as existing strategy files (e.g., strategy-ddd.md, strategy-jmeter.md)
3. WHEN the strategy guide is created THEN it SHALL be concise and focused on actionable guidance
4. WHEN the strategy guide is created THEN it SHALL include sections on purpose, key concepts, best practices, implementation patterns, and when to use stored procedures
5. WHEN the strategy guide is created THEN it SHALL include code examples that are compact and illustrative

### Requirement 4: Update Strategy Manifest

**User Story:** As a developer using the VS Code extension, I want the SQL Server stored procedures strategy registered in the manifest, so that the extension can discover and utilize this resource.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the strategy guide is created THEN the `resources/frameworks/manifest.json` file SHALL be updated
2. WHEN updating the manifest THEN a new entry SHALL be added with appropriate id, name, description, category, version, and fileName
3. WHEN updating the manifest THEN the category SHALL be set to "database" or "development" as appropriate
4. WHEN updating the manifest THEN the entry SHALL follow the existing JSON structure and formatting
5. WHEN updating the manifest THEN the version SHALL be set to "1.0.0"
