  - Create Security Considerations section covering SQL injection prevention, permissions, encryption, row-level security
  - Add Performance Optimization section with indexing, execution plans, parameter sniffing mitigation, SET NOCOUNT ON, avoiding cursors
  - Write Testing Strategies section covering tSQLt framework, test data management, mocking, integration testing
  - Document Error Handling section with TRY-CATCH blocks, RAISERROR, THROW, transaction rollback patterns
  - Create Transaction Management section covering ACID properties, isolation levels, deadlock handling, nested transactions
  - Add Parameter Handling section covering input/output parameters, table-valued parameters, default values
  - Write Result Set Patterns section covering single/multiple result sets, OUTPUT parameters, return values
  - Include When to Use vs. Alternatives section with decision framework for stored procedures vs. ORM, dynamic SQL, views
  - Ensure minimum 20 code examples across all sections demonstrating T-SQL patterns
  - Add cross-references to related frameworks (TDD/BDD, SABSA, DevOps, APM)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 2. Update framework inventory with SQL Server Stored Procedures entry
  - Open `frameworks/INVENTORY.md` file
  - Locate "Databases & Data Storage" section
  - Add new entry: `- **SQL Server Stored Procedures** - Best practices and patterns for stored procedure development`
  - Ensure entry follows existing format and naming conventions
  - Maintain alphabetical ordering within the section
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Create compact SQL Server Stored Procedures strategy guide
  - Create `resources/frameworks/strategy-sql-server-sp.md` file
  - Add front matter with inclusion: always, category: Database, framework: SQL Server Stored Procedures, description, and tags
  - Write Purpose section with quick overview of when and why to use stored procedures
  - Create Key Concepts section with essential concepts in compact format (parameterization, transactions, error handling, performance)
  - Add Best Practices section with actionable guidelines (use parameters, implement TRY-CATCH, SET NOCOUNT ON, avoid cursors, use appropriate isolation levels)
  - Write Implementation Patterns section with concise code snippets (CRUD operations, pagination, upsert, batch processing, error handling)
  - Create When to Use section with decision criteria for stored procedures vs. alternatives
  - Add Anti-Patterns section listing common mistakes to avoid (dynamic SQL without parameters, missing error handling, cursors for set operations, no transaction management)
  - Write Integration Points section showing how this relates to TDD/BDD, DevOps, Security, and APM frameworks
  - Create Quick Reference section with file locations, key commands, and common scenarios
  - Ensure all code examples are concise (< 20 lines) and illustrative
  - Follow format and style of existing strategy files (strategy-ddd.md, strategy-jmeter.md)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Update strategy manifest with SQL Server Stored Procedures entry
  - Open `resources/frameworks/manifest.json` file
  - Add new entry to the frameworks array with the following structure:
    - id: "sql-server-sp-strategy"
    - name: "SQL Server Stored Procedures Strategy"
    - description: "Best practices for designing, implementing, and maintaining SQL Server stored procedures with security and performance guidance"
    - category: "database"
    - version: "1.0.0"
    - fileName: "strategy-sql-server-sp.md"
    - dependencies: []
  - Ensure JSON syntax is valid and properly formatted
  - Maintain logical grouping with other database-related strategies
  - Verify the entry follows existing JSON structure and formatting conventions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 5. Validate implementation

  - [x] 5.1 Validate markdown syntax and formatting

    - Run markdownlint on both framework and strategy documents
    - Check for broken links and cross-references
    - Verify code block syntax highlighting is correct
    - _Requirements: All_
  
  - [x] 5.2 Validate JSON schema compliance

    - Validate manifest.json against JSON schema
    - Verify all required fields are present
    - Check for duplicate IDs in manifest
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_
  
  - [x] 5.3 Test SQL code examples



    - Execute all T-SQL code examples to verify syntax correctness
    - Ensure examples demonstrate best practices
    - Verify security patterns (parameterization) are correctly shown
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.5_
  
  - [x] 5.4 Verify framework integration


    - Confirm inventory entry appears in correct section
    - Test that VS Code extension can discover strategy guide
    - Verify cross-references between documents work
