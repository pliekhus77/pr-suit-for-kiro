# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build, test, package, and deploy the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT VS Code extension to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The pipeline will ensure quality gates are met before release, automate versioning, and provide a reliable deployment process that follows DevOps best practices.

The automation will reduce manual deployment effort, minimize human error, ensure consistent quality through automated testing and validation, and enable rapid iteration with confidence. This aligns with the DevOps strategy of continuous delivery and the project's quality-first principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Build Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to be automatically built and tested on every commit, so that I can get fast feedback on code quality and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commit is pushed to any branch THEN the system SHALL trigger a build workflow
2. WHEN the build workflow runs THEN the system SHALL restore npm dependencies
3. WHEN dependencies are restored THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript code

5. IF compilation or linting fails THEN the system SHALL fail the build and report errors
6. WHEN linting passes THEN the system SHALL execute all unit tests using Jest
7. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports
8. IF test coverage is below 80% THEN the system SHALL fail the build
9. WHEN all checks pass THEN the system SHALL mark the build as successful
10. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL upload test results and coverage reports as artifacts

### Requirement 2: Pull Request Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want pull requests to be automatically validated against quality standards, so that only high-quality code is merged into the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is opened or updated THEN the system SHALL run the full build pipeline
2. WHEN the build pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL execute all unit and integration tests
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL verify code coverage meets the 80% threshold
4. WHEN coverage is verified THEN the system SHALL run security vulnerability scanning
5. IF any critical or high severity vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL fail the PR check
6. WHEN security scan passes THEN the system SHALL validate package.json version follows semantic versioning
7. WHEN all checks pass THEN the system SHALL mark the PR as ready for review
8. IF any check fails THEN the system SHALL block PR merge and display failure details
9. WHEN PR checks complete THEN the system SHALL post a status comment with test results and coverage

### Requirement 3: Automated Versioning and Changelog

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want version numbers and changelogs to be automatically managed based on commit messages, so that releases follow semantic versioning without manual intervention.

4. WHEN commit messages start with "fix:" or "chore:" THEN the system SHALL increment the patch version
5. WHEN version is determined THEN the system SHALL update package.json with the new version number
6. WHEN package.json is updated THEN the system SHALL generate CHANGELOG.md entries from commit messages
7. WHEN changelog is generated THEN the system SHALL commit version and changelog changes back to the repository
8. WHEN changes are committed THEN the system SHALL create a git tag with the version number
9. WHEN tag is created THEN the system SHALL push the tag to the remote repository

### Requirement 4: Extension Packaging

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a version tag is pushed THEN the system SHALL trigger the packaging workflow
2. WHEN packaging starts THEN the system SHALL verify the tag matches semantic versioning format
3. WHEN tag is verified THEN the system SHALL checkout the tagged commit
4. WHEN code is checked out THEN the system SHALL install production dependencies only
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript in production mode
6. WHEN compilation completes THEN the system SHALL run vsce package command
7. WHEN vsce package runs THEN the system SHALL create a .vsix file with the version number in filename
8. WHEN .vsix is created THEN the system SHALL validate the package structure and manifest
9. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL fail the workflow and report errors
10. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL upload the .vsix file as a build artifact
11. WHEN artifact is uploaded THEN the system SHALL retain it for 90 days

### Requirement 5: Marketplace Deployment

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the extension to be automatically published to the VS Code Marketplace when a release is created, so that users can access new versions immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GitHub release is published THEN the system SHALL trigger the deployment workflow
2. WHEN deployment starts THEN the system SHALL download the .vsix artifact from the packaging workflow
3. WHEN artifact is downloaded THEN the system SHALL verify the .vsix file integrity
4. WHEN integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the VS Code Marketplace using a Personal Access Token
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fail the deployment and send notification
6. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL publish the .vsix to the marketplace using vsce publish
7. WHEN publish command runs THEN the system SHALL wait for marketplace processing confirmation
8. IF marketplace rejects the package THEN the system SHALL fail the deployment and report rejection reason
9. WHEN marketplace accepts the package THEN the system SHALL verify the extension is live on the marketplace
10. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL post a success comment on the GitHub release
11. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL send notification to configured channels

### Requirement 6: Security and Secrets Management

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all sensitive credentials to be securely stored and accessed, so that deployment secrets are never exposed in code or logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows require authentication THEN the system SHALL retrieve credentials from GitHub Secrets
2. WHEN accessing secrets THEN the system SHALL use the VSCE_PAT secret for marketplace authentication
3. WHEN secrets are used in workflows THEN the system SHALL mask secret values in all logs

7. WHEN marketplace deployment completes THEN the system SHALL post metrics (build time, test results, coverage)

### Requirement 9: Environment-Specific Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the deployment pipeline in a staging environment, so that I can validate changes before production release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow configuration is defined THEN the system SHALL support multiple environment configurations
2. WHEN deploying to staging THEN the system SHALL use a separate marketplace publisher account
