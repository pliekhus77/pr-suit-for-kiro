# Requirements Document: Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Strategy

## Introduction

This spec defines a comprehensive Application Performance Monitoring (APM) strategy guide for the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT toolkit. The strategy will provide developers with clear guidance on implementing observability, monitoring, and performance optimization across .NET applications deployed to AWS and Azure cloud platforms. This strategy document will complement existing strategies (DevOps, security, cloud hosting) by focusing specifically on application-level performance monitoring, distributed tracing, and operational excellence.

5. WHEN querying logs THEN the strategy SHALL provide examples of common queries and correlation patterns

### Requirement 6: Alerting and Incident Response

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want alerting best practices, so that I can respond to issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining alerts THEN the strategy SHALL distinguish between actionable alerts and informational notifications
2. WHEN setting alert thresholds THEN the strategy SHALL provide guidance on avoiding alert fatigue
3. IF an incident occurs THEN the strategy SHALL define escalation paths and runbook integration

### Requirement 7: Performance Profiling and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance profiling guidance, so that I can identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profiling applications THEN the strategy SHALL document CPU, memory, and I/O profiling techniques
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the strategy SHALL provide guidance on identifying N+1 queries, memory leaks, and blocking operations
3. IF optimizing code THEN the strategy SHALL reference .NET best practices (Span<T>, async/await, caching)
4. WHEN using APM tools THEN the strategy SHALL explain how to use profiling features in Application Insights and X-Ray
5. WHEN load testing THEN the strategy SHALL define integration with performance monitoring

### Requirement 8: Business Metrics and User Experience

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to track business metrics alongside technical metrics, so that I can measure actual business impact.
