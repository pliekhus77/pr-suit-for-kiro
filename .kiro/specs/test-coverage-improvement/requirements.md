# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically improving test coverage for the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT VS Code extension to meet the 80% minimum coverage target defined in our quality standards. Currently, the extension has 64.9% overall coverage with several critical components having 0% coverage, including extension activation, steering commands, and workspace commands.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the extension, I want comprehensive test coverage for the extension activation and deactivation lifecycle, so that I can ensure the extension initializes correctly and all services are properly registered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN all services SHALL be initialized correctly
2. WHEN the extension is activated THEN all commands SHALL be registered successfully  
3. WHEN the extension is activated THEN all tree view providers SHALL be registered
4. WHEN the extension is activated THEN all language feature providers SHALL be registered
5. WHEN the extension is activated THEN file system watchers SHALL be set up correctly
6. WHEN the extension is deactivated THEN cleanup SHALL occur without errors
7. WHEN activation takes longer than 500ms THEN a warning SHALL be logged
8. WHEN the welcome message is shown for the first time THEN it SHALL be marked as shown in global state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on steering document management, I want comprehensive test coverage for all steering commands, so that I can ensure custom steering documents can be created, renamed, deleted, and validated correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a custom steering document THEN the document name SHALL be validated for kebab-case format
2. WHEN creating a custom steering document THEN a template SHALL be generated with proper structure
3. WHEN creating a custom steering document THEN the file SHALL be written to the correct location
4. WHEN creating a custom steering document THEN the document SHALL be opened in the editor
5. WHEN renaming a custom steering document THEN only custom documents SHALL be allowed to be renamed
6. WHEN renaming a custom steering document THEN the new name SHALL be validated
7. WHEN renaming a custom steering document THEN the content SHALL be preserved
8. WHEN deleting a custom steering document THEN confirmation SHALL be required
9. WHEN deleting a custom steering document THEN only custom documents SHALL be allowed to be deleted
10. WHEN validating a steering document THEN validation results SHALL be displayed as diagnostics
11. WHEN validating a steering document THEN appropriate success/warning/error messages SHALL be shown

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on workspace functionality, I want comprehensive test coverage for workspace commands, so that I can ensure framework searching and reference viewing work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching frameworks THEN the frameworks directory existence SHALL be checked
2. WHEN searching frameworks AND directory doesn't exist THEN user SHALL be prompted to initialize
3. WHEN searching frameworks THEN search query SHALL be validated for minimum length
4. WHEN searching frameworks THEN search results SHALL be displayed in quick pick
5. WHEN selecting a search result THEN the file SHALL be opened at the correct line
6. WHEN viewing framework reference THEN the reference manager SHALL be called correctly
7. WHEN framework operations fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want test coverage to meet the 80% minimum standard, so that I can ensure code quality and reduce the risk of regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN overall line coverage SHALL be at least 80%
2. WHEN running tests THEN overall statement coverage SHALL be at least 80%
3. WHEN running tests THEN overall function coverage SHALL be at least 80%
4. WHEN running tests THEN overall branch coverage SHALL be at least 70%
5. WHEN critical paths are tested THEN coverage SHALL be 100%
6. WHEN public APIs are tested THEN coverage SHALL be 100%

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the extension, I want comprehensive integration tests for VS Code extension functionality, so that I can ensure the extension works correctly in the VS Code environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN extension activation SHALL be tested in VS Code environment
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN command registration SHALL be verified
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN tree view providers SHALL be tested
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN file system operations SHALL be tested with real VS Code workspace
5. WHEN running integration tests THEN user interactions SHALL be simulated and verified
