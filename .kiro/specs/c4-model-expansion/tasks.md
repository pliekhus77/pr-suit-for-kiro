# Implementation Plan

This plan breaks down the C4 model documentation expansion into discrete, manageable tasks. Each task builds incrementally on previous work, ensuring the document remains coherent and usable throughout the implementation process.

## Task Overview

The implementation is organized into six phases:
1. Foundation Enhancement (Tasks 1-3)
2. Best Practices and Anti-Patterns (Tasks 4-5)
3. Real-World Examples (Tasks 6-8)
4. Practical Guidance (Tasks 9-11)
5. Advanced Content (Tasks 12-14)
6. Polish and Validation (Task 15)
