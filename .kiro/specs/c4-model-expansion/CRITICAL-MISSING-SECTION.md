# CRITICAL: Missing "Integration with Other Frameworks" Section

## Issue Summary

Task 13 was marked as complete, but the **"Integration with Other Frameworks"** section is **MISSING** from the C4 Model document. This section is required by Requirement 5 and must be added to complete the documentation.

## Required Location

Insert this section **AFTER** the "Advanced Techniques" section (around line 14800) and **BEFORE** the "Tooling and Automation" section (line 14805).

## Required Content Structure

```markdown
## Integration with Other Frameworks

The C4 model works exceptionally well alongside other architecture and development frameworks. Rather than replacing these frameworks, C4 complements them by providing a consistent visualization approach. This section shows how to integrate C4 with popular frameworks used in modern software development.

### C4 and Domain-Driven Design

[Content about bounded contexts, aggregates, context mapping, etc.]

### C4 and Microservices

[Content about service boundaries, API contracts, dependencies, etc.]

### C4 and Cloud Architectures  

[Content about AWS/Azure/GCP services, managed services, etc.]

### C4 and Event-Driven Architecture

[Content about event buses, choreography vs orchestration, etc.]

### C4 and Architecture Decision Records

[Content about linking diagrams to ADRs, traceability, etc.]

### C4 and Well-Architected Frameworks

[Content about AWS/Azure pillars, trade-offs, etc.]
```

## Detailed Requirements (from Task 13)

### 1. C4 and Domain-Driven Design
- Bounded contexts as containers
- Aggregates as components  
- Context mapping visualization
- Strategic vs. tactical design
- **Complete example** showing DDD + C4 for a domain-driven system

### 2. C4 and Microservices
- Service boundaries
- API contracts
- Service dependencies
- Data ownership
- **Complete example** showing microservices architecture with C4

### 3. C4 and Cloud Architectures
- AWS/Azure/GCP service representation
- Managed services vs. custom code
- **Complete example** showing cloud-native application architecture

### 4. C4 and Event-Driven Architecture
- Event buses, publishers/subscribers
- Event flows
- Choreography vs. orchestration patterns
- **Complete example** showing event-driven system with C4

### 5. C4 and Architecture Decision Records
- Linking diagrams to ADRs
- Documenting decisions visually
- Traceability and evolution over time

### 6. C4 and Well-Architected Frameworks
- Mapping to AWS/Azure pillars
- Mapping to Azure Well-Architected pillars
- Documenting architectural characteristics
- Trade-off visualization techniques

## Estimated Size

- **1,500-2,000 lines** of content
- **10-15 Mermaid diagrams**
- **4 complete examples** (DDD, Microservices, Cloud, Event-Driven)

## Why This Matters

This section is critical because:
1. It satisfies Requirement 5 (Integration with Other Frameworks)
2. It addresses acceptance criteria 5.1-5.5
3. The project uses multiple frameworks (see frameworks/ directory)
4. It shows how C4 complements rather than replaces other frameworks
5. It provides practical integration guidance for real-world usage

## Current Status

- ❌ Section is completely missing
- ✅ Some related content exists in Advanced Techniques (microservices, event-driven)
- ✅ DDD concepts mentioned throughout but not in dedicated integration section
- ❌ No dedicated examples showing framework integration
- ❌ No coverage of Well-Architected Frameworks integration

## Action Required

**MUST ADD** this section to complete Task 15 and achieve 100% requirements coverage.

Without this section, the document is at 91.7% completion (11/12 requirements met).
