# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current C4 model framework documentation provides a solid foundation covering the core concepts, diagram levels, and basic usage. However, to provide a "full and complete understanding" with best practices, we need to expand it significantly. This enhancement will transform the documentation into a comprehensive reference that includes:

- Detailed best practices and anti-patterns for each diagram level
- Real-world examples with complete diagram representations
- Step-by-step guidance for creating effective diagrams
- Integration patterns with other frameworks (DDD, microservices, cloud architectures)
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Advanced techniques for complex systems
- Tooling recommendations with practical examples
- Governance and maintenance strategies
- Team collaboration patterns

The expanded documentation should serve as both a learning resource for newcomers and a reference guide for experienced practitioners.
