### ❌ Critical Issue: Missing Section

**Section:** Integration with Other Frameworks  
**Task:** 13 (marked as complete but section is missing)  
**Requirement:** 5 (Integration with Other Frameworks)  
**Impact:** Document is incomplete, Requirement 5 not satisfied

**Required Content:**
1. C4 and Domain-Driven Design (bounded contexts, aggregates, complete example)
2. C4 and Microservices (service boundaries, API contracts, complete example)
3. C4 and Cloud Architectures (AWS/Azure/GCP, complete example)
4. C4 and Event-Driven Architecture (event buses, choreography, complete example)
5. C4 and Architecture Decision Records (linking diagrams to ADRs)
6. C4 and Well-Architected Frameworks (AWS/Azure pillars, trade-offs)

**Estimated Size:** 1,500-2,000 lines  
**Location:** Insert after "Advanced Techniques" (line ~14800), before "Tooling and Automation" (line 14805)

**Why Critical:**
- Satisfies Requirement 5 and acceptance criteria 5.1-5.5
- Project uses multiple frameworks (see frameworks/ directory)
- Shows how C4 complements other frameworks
- Provides practical integration guidance

### ✅ Minor Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed duplicate section header**
   - Changed second "Supplementary Diagrams" to "Core Concepts: Relationships"
   - Content now properly categorized

2. **Verified text formatting**
   - No truncation issues found (PowerShell display artifact only)
   - All text properly formatted

---

## Files Created

1. **validation-report.md** - Comprehensive validation report with detailed findings
2. **CRITICAL-MISSING-SECTION.md** - Detailed specification of missing content
3. **TASK-15-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md** - This file

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required (Priority 1)

**ADD the "Integration with Other Frameworks" section**

This is the ONLY remaining item to achieve 100% completion. The section must include:

- 6 subsections (DDD, Microservices, Cloud, Event-Driven, ADRs, Well-Architected)
- 4 complete examples with Mermaid diagrams
- Integration guidance for each framework
- Cross-references to relevant sections

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours to create comprehensive content  
**Location:** Line 14805 in frameworks/c4-model.md

### Optional Enhancements (Priority 2)

1. Add "Last Updated: April 2025" to tool-specific sections
2. Consider adding more cross-references between sections
3. Add index or glossary if document continues to grow
