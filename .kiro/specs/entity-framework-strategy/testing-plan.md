# Testing Plan: Entity Framework Strategy

**Created:** 2025-10-07 | **Updated:** 2025-10-07 | **Status:** Draft

## Test Strategy

**Scope:** Validation of Entity Framework documentation files, content quality, and integration with the extension framework.

**Approach:** Unit testing for file operations and content validation, integration testing for extension discovery, manual review for content quality.

**Pyramid:** Unit 70%, Integration 20%, Manual Review 10%

## Unit Test Scenarios

### File Creation and Structure

**Happy Path:**
- GIVEN no existing Entity Framework documentation WHEN creating framework guide THEN file is created at `frameworks/entity-framework-strategy.md` with correct structure
- GIVEN no existing strategy guide WHEN creating strategy guide THEN file is created at `resources/frameworks/strategy-entity-framework.md` with front matter
- GIVEN valid content WHEN writing files THEN all sections are present and properly formatted

**Failure Path:**
- GIVEN file already exists WHEN creating file THEN prompt for overwrite or fail gracefully
- GIVEN invalid file path WHEN creating file THEN throw appropriate error with clear message
- GIVEN insufficient permissions WHEN writing file THEN throw permission error

**Edge Cases:**
- GIVEN empty content WHEN creating file THEN create file with template structure
- GIVEN very large content WHEN writing file THEN handle efficiently without memory issues
- GIVEN special characters in content WHEN writing file THEN properly escape and encode

### Inventory Update

**Happy Path:**
- GIVEN valid inventory file WHEN adding Entity Framework entry THEN entry is added in correct section
- GIVEN existing entries WHEN adding new entry THEN maintain alphabetical order
- GIVEN valid entry format WHEN updating inventory THEN formatting matches existing entries

**Failure Path:**
- GIVEN missing inventory file WHEN updating THEN create file or throw clear error
- GIVEN corrupted inventory file WHEN updating THEN detect corruption and report error
- GIVEN duplicate entry WHEN adding THEN detect duplicate and prevent addition

**Edge Cases:**
- GIVEN empty section WHEN adding first entry THEN create section properly
- GIVEN section doesn't exist WHEN adding entry THEN create section or report error
- GIVEN malformed markdown WHEN updating THEN detect and report formatting issues

### Manifest Update

**Happy Path:**
- GIVEN valid manifest.json WHEN adding Entity Framework entry THEN JSON remains valid
- GIVEN existing entries WHEN adding new entry THEN maintain proper JSON structure
- GIVEN valid framework data WHEN creating entry THEN all required fields are present

**Failure Path:**
- GIVEN invalid JSON WHEN updating manifest THEN detect syntax error and report line number
- GIVEN missing required fields WHEN creating entry THEN validate and report missing fields
- GIVEN duplicate ID WHEN adding entry THEN detect conflict and prevent addition

**Edge Cases:**
- GIVEN empty manifest WHEN adding first entry THEN create valid JSON structure
- GIVEN trailing commas WHEN parsing JSON THEN handle gracefully
- GIVEN comments in JSON WHEN parsing THEN strip comments or report error

**Range/Boundary:**
- Version numbers: "0.0.1", "1.0.0", "99.99.99"
- ID lengths: 1 char, 50 chars, 100 chars
- Description lengths: empty, 100 chars, 500 chars
- Dependencies array: 0 items, 1 item, 10 items

### Content Validation

**Happy Path:**
- GIVEN valid C# code examples WHEN validating THEN all examples pass syntax check
- GIVEN valid markdown WHEN validating THEN markdown renders correctly
- GIVEN valid front matter WHEN parsing THEN all fields are extracted correctly

**Failure Path:**
- GIVEN invalid C# syntax WHEN validating THEN report syntax errors with line numbers
- GIVEN broken markdown links WHEN validating THEN report broken links
- GIVEN invalid front matter WHEN parsing THEN report parsing errors

**Edge Cases:**
- GIVEN code with special characters WHEN validating THEN handle escaping correctly
- GIVEN very long code examples WHEN validating THEN handle efficiently
- GIVEN nested code blocks WHEN parsing THEN parse correctly

## Integration Test Scenarios

### Extension Discovery

**Happy Path:**
- GIVEN updated manifest WHEN extension loads THEN Entity Framework is discoverable
- GIVEN strategy guide with front matter WHEN spec includes file reference THEN content is loaded
- GIVEN valid file paths WHEN extension accesses files THEN files are read successfully

**Failure Path:**
- GIVEN missing strategy guide WHEN spec references it THEN report missing file error
- GIVEN invalid manifest WHEN extension loads THEN report validation error
- GIVEN broken file reference WHEN loading THEN report reference error

### Cross-Reference Validation

**Happy Path:**
- GIVEN links to DDD framework WHEN validating THEN links resolve correctly
- GIVEN links to TDD/BDD strategy WHEN validating THEN links resolve correctly
- GIVEN file references in strategy guide WHEN loading THEN references work

**Failure Path:**
- GIVEN broken link to framework WHEN validating THEN report broken link
- GIVEN missing referenced file WHEN loading THEN report missing file
- GIVEN circular references WHEN loading THEN detect and report

## Manual Review Scenarios

### Content Quality Review

**Review Checklist:**
- All code examples compile and follow .NET best practices
- Documentation style matches existing framework guides
- Tone and language are consistent with other guides
- Technical accuracy of Entity Framework concepts
- Completeness of coverage (DbContext, entities, migrations, queries, testing)
- Integration examples with DDD are accurate
- Security guidance is comprehensive and correct
- Anti-patterns are clearly explained with solutions

### Consistency Review

**Review Checklist:**
- Strategy guide follows template structure
- Front matter format matches other strategy guides
- Manifest entry format matches existing entries
- Inventory entry format is consistent
- Cross-references use consistent terminology
- Code example style is consistent throughout

### Usability Review

**Review Checklist:**
- Strategy guide is concise (2-4 pages)
- Quick reference section is helpful
- Code examples are minimal but complete
- Sections are easy to scan and find information
- Integration points are clearly identified
- When to use guidance is actionable

## Test Data

### Test Data Sets

**Happy Path Data:**
- Valid framework guide content with all sections
- Valid strategy guide with proper front matter
- Valid manifest entry with all required fields
- Valid inventory entry in correct format

**Invalid Data:**
- Malformed JSON in manifest
- Missing front matter in strategy guide
- Incomplete framework guide sections
- Duplicate entries in inventory

**Edge Case Data:**
- Empty files
- Very large content (>1MB)
- Special characters in content
- Unicode characters in examples

### Test Data Management

**Location:** `tests/fixtures/entity-framework-strategy/`

**Generation Method:**
- Template-based generation for valid data
- Mutation-based generation for invalid data
- Manual creation for edge cases

**Cleanup Strategy:**
- Delete test files after each test
- Restore original files if modified
- Use temporary directories for test output

## Coverage Goals

**Overall:** 80% code coverage for file operations and validation logic

**Critical Paths:** 100% coverage for:
- File creation and writing
- JSON parsing and validation
- Manifest updates
- Inventory updates

**Public APIs:** 100% coverage for:
- File creation functions
- Validation functions
- Manifest update functions

**Business Logic:** 90%+ coverage for:
- Content validation
- Cross-reference checking
- Format validation

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

**File System Operations:**
- Risk: File corruption or data loss
- Mitigation: Atomic writes (write to temp, then rename), backup before modification
- Extra Testing: Integration tests with real file system, error injection tests

**JSON Parsing:**
- Risk: Invalid JSON breaks extension
- Mitigation: Strict validation before writing, schema validation
- Extra Testing: Fuzz testing with malformed JSON, boundary testing

**Content Validation:**
- Risk: Invalid code examples in documentation
- Mitigation: Automated syntax checking, manual review
- Extra Testing: Compile all code examples, test with different .NET versions

**Cross-References:**
- Risk: Broken links break user workflow
- Mitigation: Automated link checking, integration tests
- Extra Testing: Test all reference paths, test with missing files

### Test Priorities

**P1 (Must Have):**
- File creation and structure validation
- JSON manifest validation
- Inventory update correctness
- Basic content validation

**P2 (Should Have):**
- Code example syntax validation

## Notes

This testing plan focuses on validation and quality assurance of documentation artifacts rather than traditional software testing. The emphasis is on ensuring:

1. **Correctness:** All files are created correctly with proper structure
2. **Validity:** JSON is valid, markdown renders, code compiles
3. **Consistency:** Formatting and style match existing frameworks
4. **Integration:** Files work correctly with the extension
5. **Quality:** Content is accurate, complete, and useful

The testing approach combines automated validation (unit/integration tests) with manual review (content quality, technical accuracy) to ensure high-quality documentation that serves developers effectively.
