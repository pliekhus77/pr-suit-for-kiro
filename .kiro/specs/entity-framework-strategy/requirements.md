# Requirements Document: Entity Framework Strategy

## Introduction

This feature will create comprehensive Entity Framework documentation and strategy guides for the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT extension. Entity Framework (EF) is Microsoft's object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with databases using .NET objects. This documentation will provide best practices, patterns, and guidance for using Entity Framework effectively in enterprise applications.

The documentation will follow the same structure as other framework guides in the project, including a detailed framework document, inventory tracking, a compact strategy guide for steering, and manifest integration for the VS Code extension.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create Detailed Entity Framework Framework Document

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want comprehensive Entity Framework documentation so that I can follow best practices when implementing data access layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the framework document THEN the system SHALL create a file at `frameworks/entity-framework-strategy.md`
2. WHEN writing the framework document THEN it SHALL include sections on EF Core vs EF6, DbContext configuration, entity configuration, migrations, querying patterns, performance optimization, and testing strategies
3. WHEN documenting patterns THEN it SHALL include code examples in C# showing proper implementation
4. WHEN covering best practices THEN it SHALL address connection management, transaction handling, lazy loading vs eager loading, and change tracking
5. WHEN discussing architecture THEN it SHALL integrate with Domain-Driven Design patterns (Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Repositories)
6. WHEN providing guidance THEN it SHALL include anti-patterns to avoid and their solutions
7. WHEN documenting testing THEN it SHALL cover unit testing with in-memory providers and integration testing strategies

### Requirement 2: Update Framework Inventory

**User Story:** As a developer browsing available frameworks, I want Entity Framework listed in the inventory so that I can discover it alongside other frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the inventory THEN the system SHALL modify `frameworks/INVENTORY.md`
2. WHEN adding the entry THEN it SHALL include the framework name, category (Data Access), description, and file reference
3. WHEN categorizing THEN it SHALL be placed in the appropriate section (Data & Persistence or similar)
4. WHEN listing THEN it SHALL maintain alphabetical order within its category
5. WHEN describing THEN it SHALL provide a concise summary of what Entity Framework provides

### Requirement 3: Create Compact Strategy Guide

**User Story:** As a developer working on a feature, I want a compact Entity Framework strategy guide automatically included in my context so that I have quick access to key patterns without reading the full documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the strategy guide THEN the system SHALL create a file at `resources/frameworks/strategy-entity-framework.md`
2. WHEN writing the strategy guide THEN it SHALL be concise (2-4 pages maximum) focusing on most critical patterns
3. WHEN structuring content THEN it SHALL include quick reference tables for common scenarios
4. WHEN providing examples THEN it SHALL show minimal code snippets for key patterns
5. WHEN covering topics THEN it SHALL include DbContext setup, entity configuration, repository pattern, query optimization, and migration workflow
6. WHEN formatting THEN it SHALL use markdown tables, bullet points, and clear section headers for scannability
7. WHEN integrating with steering THEN it SHALL be suitable for automatic inclusion via file references in spec documents

### Requirement 4: Update Manifest Configuration

**User Story:** As a user of the VS Code extension, I want Entity Framework strategy automatically available when working on data access features so that I receive contextual guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the manifest THEN the system SHALL modify `resources/frameworks/manifest.json`
2. WHEN adding the entry THEN it SHALL include framework name, category, file paths for both detailed and strategy documents
3. WHEN configuring THEN it SHALL specify appropriate keywords/tags for discovery (entity-framework, ef-core, orm, data-access, database)
4. WHEN integrating THEN it SHALL follow the same structure as existing framework entries
5. WHEN validating THEN the manifest SHALL remain valid JSON with proper formatting

### Requirement 5: Content Quality and Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple framework guides, I want Entity Framework documentation to follow the same structure and quality standards so that I have a consistent learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN it SHALL follow the same structure as existing framework documents (TDD, BDD, C4 Model, etc.)
2. WHEN writing content THEN it SHALL use the same tone and style as other framework guides
3. WHEN providing examples THEN it SHALL use realistic scenarios relevant to enterprise applications
4. WHEN referencing other frameworks THEN it SHALL link to related documents (DDD, testing strategies, clean architecture)
5. WHEN documenting patterns THEN it SHALL explain the "why" behind recommendations, not just the "how"
6. WHEN covering advanced topics THEN it SHALL include references to official Microsoft documentation
7. WHEN addressing security THEN it SHALL cover SQL injection prevention, connection string security, and data protection

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Frameworks

**User Story:** As a developer following multiple framework guides, I want Entity Framework guidance to integrate with DDD, Clean Architecture, and testing strategies so that I can apply patterns cohesively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting repository pattern THEN it SHALL reference Domain-Driven Design aggregate boundaries
2. WHEN covering entity configuration THEN it SHALL align with DDD Entity and Value Object patterns
3. WHEN discussing testing THEN it SHALL reference the TDD/BDD strategy guide
4. WHEN showing architecture THEN it SHALL demonstrate integration with Clean Architecture layers
5. WHEN providing examples THEN it SHALL show how EF fits within the overall application architecture
