# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create Clean Architecture framework documentation
  - Create comprehensive framework documentation file at `frameworks/clean-architecture.md` following Milan Jovanovic's pragmatic approach
  - Include four-layer architecture explanation (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation) with Milan's specific folder structures
  - Document CQRS patterns with MediatR integration examples and code templates
  - Add vertical slice architecture guidance with REPR pattern implementation
  - Include pragmatic flexibility guidelines for breaking rules when beneficial
  - Add real-world examples for entities, value objects, aggregates, commands, queries, and handlers
  - Include modern .NET tech stack integration (EF Core, FluentValidation, Serilog, JWT, Docker)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 9.1, 9.2, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5_

- [x] 2. Create Clean Architecture steering documentation
  - Create steering file at `.kiro/steering/strategy-pragmatic-clean-architecture.md` with team guidance and standards
  - Include project-specific Pragmatic Clean Architecture adoption guidelines and best practices
  - Document when to use Pragmatic Clean Architecture vs other patterns in the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT context
  - Add team onboarding checklist and learning path for Pragmatic Clean Architecture
  - Include pragmatic decision framework for architectural trade-offs
  - _Requirements: 8.4, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5_

- [x] 3. Register framework in inventory systems
  - Update `frameworks/INVENTORY.md` to include Pragmatic Clean Architecture framework entry
  - Add framework metadata including Milan Jovanovic approach, CQRS patterns, and vertical slices
  - Include usage guidelines and when to apply Clean Architecture
  - Add links to framework documentation and steering guidance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 8.5_

- [x] 4. Add framework integration examples
  - Include examples of combining Pragmatic Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design patterns
  - Add integration examples with Test-Driven Development workflows
  - Document how Pragmatic Clean Architecture works with existing Pragmatic Rhino SUIT frameworks
  - Include migration examples from traditional layered architectures to Pragmatic Clean Architecture
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 5. Document architectural validation with NetArchTest

  - Add NetArchTest documentation section to `frameworks/clean-architecture.md` with installation and setup guidance
  - Document unit test patterns for validating dependency rules between layers (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation)
  - Provide example test code templates that ensure Domain layer has no dependencies on outer layers
  - Document validation test patterns for CQRS ensuring commands and queries follow proper separation
  - Add example tests that validate Infrastructure implementations don't leak into Domain or Application layers
  - Include documentation for testing vertical slice boundaries and coupling rules
  - Document pragmatic override patterns for justified architectural rule violations
  - Add guidance for integrating NetArchTest validation into CI/CD pipelines for continuous architectural compliance
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 7.1, 7.2, 15.1, 15.2_
