# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a comprehensive Clean Architecture framework to the Pragmatic Rhino SUIT extension. The framework will be based on Milan Jovanovic's pragmatic approach to Clean Architecture, which builds upon Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob) original concepts while incorporating modern .NET practices, CQRS patterns, and vertical slice architecture. Milan's approach emphasizes practical implementation over dogmatic adherence, focusing on maintainability, flexibility, and developer productivity.

The framework will provide a four-layer architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation) with CQRS implementation, vertical slice organization, and modern tech stack integration including MediatR, Entity Framework Core, FluentValidation, and structured logging. This pragmatic approach allows teams to apply Clean Architecture principles while maintaining flexibility to adapt patterns based on specific project needs.
