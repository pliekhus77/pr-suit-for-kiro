# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a VS Code extension that supports GitHub's spec-kit methodology through two distinct scenarios:

1. **Standalone Spec-Kit Usage**: Enable developers to use spec-kit independently within VS Code for Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
2. **Kiro Steering Integration**: Allow developers to leverage existing Kiro steering files as spec-kit constitution files, combining framework-driven guidance with spec-kit's AI-powered workflow

These scenarios operate independently - users can choose to use spec-kit on its own or enhance it with Kiro's existing framework knowledge through steering file integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Standalone Spec-Kit Project Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize and manage spec-kit projects within VS Code, so that I can use GitHub's SDD methodology without leaving my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the command palette and select "Spec-Kit: Initialize Project" THEN the system SHALL prompt me for project configuration options (AI agent, script type, directory location)
2. WHEN I provide valid project configuration THEN the system SHALL execute the spec-kit CLI initialization process and create the necessary project structure
3. WHEN initialization completes THEN the system SHALL display a success notification and refresh the workspace to show the new spec-kit project files
4. IF the current directory already contains files THEN the system SHALL warn me and offer options to merge or create in a subdirectory

### Requirement 2 - Spec-Kit Command Execution

**User Story:** As a developer working with spec-kit, I want to execute spec-kit slash commands through VS Code interface, so that I can manage the specification-driven development workflow efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a spec-kit enabled workspace THEN the system SHALL detect the spec-kit configuration and enable spec-kit commands
2. WHEN I access the command palette THEN the system SHALL show available spec-kit commands (/speckit.constitution, /speckit.specify, /speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks, /speckit.implement, /speckit.clarify, /speckit.analyze, /speckit.checklist)
3. WHEN I execute a spec-kit command THEN the system SHALL prompt for required parameters and execute the command through the configured AI agent
4. WHEN a command completes THEN the system SHALL update the relevant specification files and refresh the file explorer
5. IF a command fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message and provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3 - Kiro Steering Files as Constitution

**User Story:** As a developer with existing Kiro steering files, I want to use them as spec-kit constitution files, so that I can leverage my existing framework knowledge in spec-kit workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have a workspace with `.kiro/steering/` directory THEN the system SHALL detect steering files and offer to use them as spec-kit constitution
2. WHEN I enable steering-as-constitution mode THEN the system SHALL combine relevant steering files (tech.md, structure.md, strategy-*.md, product.md) into a constitution context
3. WHEN I execute `/speckit.constitution` command THEN the system SHALL use the combined steering files content instead of creating a new constitution
4. WHEN steering files are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the constitution context for subsequent spec-kit operations

### Requirement 4 - AI Agent Configuration and Management

**User Story:** As a developer working with multiple AI agents, I want to configure and switch between different AI agents for spec-kit operations, so that I can use the most appropriate agent for each task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access spec-kit settings THEN the system SHALL allow me to configure supported AI agents (Claude, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, Qwen, etc.)
2. WHEN I have multiple agents configured THEN the system SHALL allow me to select which agent to use for each spec-kit command
3. WHEN I execute a spec-kit command THEN the system SHALL use the selected AI agent and handle agent-specific authentication and communication
4. IF an AI agent is not available or configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and configuration guidance

### Requirement 5 - Spec-Kit Document Management

**User Story:** As a developer managing specifications, I want to view and edit spec-kit documents with enhanced support, so that I can work efficiently with the specification files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a spec-kit specification file (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and structure validation
2. WHEN I edit specification content THEN the system SHALL offer auto-completion for spec-kit template sections and common patterns
3. WHEN I save a specification file THEN the system SHALL validate the content against spec-kit requirements and show diagnostics for any issues
4. WHEN I view a specification file THEN the system SHALL provide outline navigation for quick section jumping

### Requirement 6 - Spec-Kit Project Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer managing spec-kit projects, I want to visualize and navigate the specification workflow, so that I can understand project status and next steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a spec-kit project THEN the system SHALL display a tree view showing the current feature branches and their specification status
2. WHEN I view the spec-kit tree THEN the system SHALL indicate which specifications are complete, in progress, or missing
3. WHEN I click on a specification in the tree THEN the system SHALL open the corresponding file for editing
4. WHEN I right-click on a feature in the tree THEN the system SHALL show context menu options for spec-kit operations (specify, plan, implement, etc.)

### Requirement 7 - Operation Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring spec-kit operations, I want to track the progress and results of AI agent interactions, so that I can understand what's happening and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spec-kit commands are executed THEN the system SHALL log all AI agent interactions in a dedicated output channel
2. WHEN I view the spec-kit output THEN the system SHALL show command execution status, AI responses, and any errors
3. WHEN an operation takes a long time THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary information about what was created or modified
