# Design Document: JMeter Performance Testing Strategy Guide

## Overview

This design document outlines the structure and content for a comprehensive JMeter performance testing strategy guide that will be stored at `.kiro/steering/strategy-jmeter.md`. The guide will provide developers and QA engineers with standardized approaches, best practices, and patterns for implementing performance testing using Apache JMeter, complementing existing testing strategies (TDD/BDD) by focusing on non-functional performance requirements.

The guide follows the established format of other strategy guides in the project, ensuring consistency and ease of adoption across teams. It integrates seamlessly with existing project standards including testing-plan.md templates, BDD feature files, and the overall spec-driven development workflow.

## Architecture

### Document Structure

The strategy guide will follow a hierarchical structure with the following major sections:

```
strategy-jmeter.md
├── Purpose & Scope
├── Core Concepts & Terminology
├── Test Types & Selection
├── Test Design & Planning
├── Test Script Structure & Best Practices
├── Correlation & Dynamic Data Handling
├── Performance Metrics & Analysis
├── CI/CD Integration & Automation
├── Distributed Testing & Scalability
├── Best Practices & Anti-Patterns
├── Integration with Project Standards
├── Tool Ecosystem & Extensions
└── Real-World Examples & Templates
```

**Design Decision:** This structure mirrors the requirements document sections while organizing content in a logical learning progression from foundational concepts to advanced topics.

**Rationale:** Users can either read sequentially for comprehensive understanding or jump to specific sections as reference material during implementation.

### Content Organization Pattern

Each major section will follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Introduction** - Brief overview of the topic
2. **Core Content** - Detailed explanations with examples
3. **Decision Matrices/Tables** - Quick reference for common decisions
4. **Code/Configuration Examples** - Practical implementations
5. **Integration Points** - References to other project standards
6. **Common Pitfalls** - Anti-patterns to avoid

**Design Decision:** Use tables, code blocks, and visual aids (Mermaid diagrams where applicable) for quick scanning and reference.

**Rationale:** Strategy guides serve dual purposes: learning resources for new team members and quick reference for experienced developers. This pattern supports both use cases.

## Components and Interfaces
