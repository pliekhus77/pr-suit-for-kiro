# Requirements Document: JMeter Performance Testing Strategy Guide

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a comprehensive JMeter performance testing strategy guide. The guide will provide developers and QA engineers with standardized approaches, best practices, and patterns for implementing performance testing using Apache JMeter. This strategy guide will complement the existing testing strategies (TDD/BDD) by focusing specifically on non-functional performance requirements including load testing, stress testing, spike testing, and endurance testing.

The guide will be stored in `.kiro/steering/strategy-jmeter.md` and will follow the same format and structure as other strategy guides in the project, ensuring consistency and ease of adoption across teams.
