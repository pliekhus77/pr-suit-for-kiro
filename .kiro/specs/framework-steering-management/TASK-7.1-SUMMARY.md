# Task 7.1 Implementation Summary: Update Detection

## Overview
Implemented framework update detection functionality that checks for available updates on extension activation and notifies users when updates are available.

## Implementation Details

### 1. FrameworkManager Service
The `checkForUpdates()` method was already implemented in `FrameworkManager` class:
- Compares installed framework versions with manifest versions
- Returns list of `FrameworkUpdate` objects with version info
- Handles cases where frameworks are not in manifest or no frameworks are installed

### 2. Extension Activation Integration
Added update detection to extension activation in `src/extension.ts`:

**New Functions:**
- `checkForFrameworkUpdates()`: Called on activation to check for updates
  - Silently fails if errors occur (doesn't interrupt activation)
  - Shows notification if updates are available
  - Provides "View Updates" and "Dismiss" options

- `showUpdatesList()`: Displays available updates in a quick pick
  - Shows framework ID, version change (current → latest), and changes
  - Allows user to select a framework to update
  - Calls `frameworkManager.updateFramework()` on selection
  - Shows success/error messages

**Notification Behavior:**
- Single update: "1 framework update available"
- Multiple updates: "X framework updates available"
- User can view updates or dismiss
- Clicking "View Updates" shows quick pick with all available updates

### 3. Update Detection Logic
The `checkForUpdates()` method:
1. Loads installed frameworks metadata from `.kiro/.metadata/installed-frameworks.json`
2. Compares each installed framework version with manifest version
3. Returns updates only for frameworks where versions differ
4. Skips frameworks not found in manifest
5. Returns empty array if no frameworks installed or no updates available

### 4. Test Coverage
Added comprehensive unit tests in `src/services/__tests__/framework-manager.test.ts`:

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Detect no updates when versions match
- ✅ Detect updates when version differs
- ✅ Detect multiple updates
- ✅ Return empty array when no frameworks installed
- ✅ Skip frameworks not in manifest
- ✅ Include version info in update object (frameworkId, currentVersion, latestVersion, changes)

**All 54 tests pass** including the 6 new update detection tests.

## Files Modified

1. **src/extension.ts**
   - Added `checkForFrameworkUpdates()` function
   - Added `showUpdatesList()` function
   - Integrated update check into activation flow
   - Imported `FrameworkUpdate` type

2. **src/services/__tests__/framework-manager.test.ts**
   - Added "Update Detection" test suite with 6 tests
   - All tests passing

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **4.1**: Check for updates on extension activation  
✅ **4.2**: Show notification when updates available  
✅ **4.3**: Compare installed versions with manifest versions  
✅ **4.4**: Return list of outdated frameworks with version info  
✅ **4.5**: Handle cases where no updates available  
✅ **4.6**: Handle cases where no frameworks installed  
✅ **4.7**: Skip frameworks not in manifest  
✅ **4.8**: Provide user-friendly notification with action buttons

## User Experience

1. **On Extension Activation:**
   - Extension checks for updates in background
   - If updates available, shows notification: "X framework updates available"
   - User can click "View Updates" or "Dismiss"

2. **Viewing Updates:**
   - Quick pick shows all available updates
   - Each item displays: framework ID, version change, and changes
   - User selects framework to update
   - Update is applied and success message shown

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Update check errors don't interrupt activation
   - Update failures show error message to user
   - Gracefully handles missing metadata files

## Testing Results

```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       54 passed, 54 total
Time:        2.021 s
```

All tests pass including:
- 48 existing tests (manifest loading, installation, conflict detection, etc.)
- 6 new update detection tests

## Next Steps

Task 7.1 is complete. The next task (7.2) will implement:
- Framework update logic with customization detection
- Backup creation for customized files
- Diff preview of changes before updating
- Warning users about customized frameworks

## Notes

- The `checkForUpdates()` method was already implemented in FrameworkManager
- This task focused on integrating it into the extension activation flow
- Update detection runs asynchronously and doesn't block activation
- Errors are logged but don't interrupt the user experience
- The notification provides clear action buttons for user choice
