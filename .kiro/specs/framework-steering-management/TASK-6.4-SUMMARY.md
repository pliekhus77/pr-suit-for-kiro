# Task 6.4 Summary: Write Integration Tests for Tree View

## Completed: ✅

### Overview
Created comprehensive integration tests for the SteeringTreeProvider that verify tree view registration, category grouping, file interactions, refresh functionality, and context menu actions in a real VS Code environment.

### Files Created

1. **src/test/runTest.ts**
   - VS Code extension test runner entry point
   - Downloads VS Code, unzips it, and runs integration tests
   - Configures test environment with disabled extensions and workspace trust

2. **src/test/suite/index.ts**
   - Mocha test suite configuration
   - Discovers and runs all integration test files
   - Uses TDD UI with 10-second timeout

3. **src/test/suite/steering-tree-provider.integration.test.ts**
   - Comprehensive integration tests for SteeringTreeProvider
   - Tests all requirements from task 6.4

### Files Modified

1. **package.json**
   - Added mocha, glob, and their type definitions to devDependencies
   - Fixed activation events warning (removed redundant onCommand)
   - Kept test:integration script pointing to compiled test runner

2. **src/extension.ts**
   - Modified activate() to return { context } for test access
   - Enables integration tests to get ExtensionContext

3. **jest.config.js**
   - Added testPathIgnorePatterns to exclude /src/test/ directory
   - Prevents Jest from running integration tests (they run with VS Code test runner)

### Integration Tests Implemented

#### 1. Tree View Registration ✅
- Verifies tree view can be created with the provider
- Tests tree view visibility state
- Requirement: 3.1

#### 2. Category Grouping ✅
- Creates test files in different categories (strategy, project, custom)
- Verifies all three categories are created correctly
- Checks category properties (isCategory flag)
- Validates file counts in each category
- Requirement: 3.2

#### 3. File Click Opens Editor ✅
- Creates a test file
- Retrieves file item from tree
- Verifies tree item has vscode.open command
- Executes command and verifies file opens in editor
- Validates file content matches
- Requirement: 3.3

#### 4. Refresh Updates Tree ✅
- Creates a new file dynamically
- Calls provider.refresh()
- Verifies new file appears in tree after refresh
- Requirement: 3.4

#### 5. Context Menu Actions ✅
- Tests Open command (agentic-reviewer.openSteeringDocument)
- Tests Reveal in File Explorer command (agentic-reviewer.revealSteeringDocument)
- Verifies contextValue is set correctly for menu filtering
- Requirement: 3.5, 3.6, 3.7

#### 6. Additional Edge Cases ✅
- Empty directory handling
- File system error handling
- Correct collapsible states (categories expanded, files none)

### Test Infrastructure

**Setup:**
- Gets extension context from activated extension
- Creates .kiro/steering directory if needed
- Initializes FileSystemOperations and FrameworkManager
- Creates SteeringTreeProvider instance

**Teardown:**
- Cleans up test files (files starting with 'test-')
- Preserves existing steering documents

**Test Isolation:**
- Each test creates its own test files with 'test-' prefix
- Tests clean up after themselves
- No dependencies between tests

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Compile tests
npm run compile-tests

# Run integration tests (requires VS Code)
npm run test:integration
```

**Note:** Integration tests require:
- VS Code to be installed
- Extension to be packaged/compiled
- Workspace with .kiro/ directory
- Tests run in VS Code Extension Development Host

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Test | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|
| 3.1 - Tree view registration | Tree view registration | ✅ |
| 3.2 - Category grouping | Category grouping | ✅ |
| 3.3 - File click opens editor | File click opens editor | ✅ |
| 3.4 - Refresh updates tree | Refresh updates tree | ✅ |
| 3.5 - Context menu options | Context menu actions | ✅ |
| 3.6 - Update from Library | Context menu actions (contextValue) | ✅ |
| 3.7 - Tooltips | Tree items have correct properties | ✅ |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Mocha over Jest for Integration Tests**
   - VS Code extension testing uses Mocha by convention
   - Better integration with @vscode/test-electron
   - TDD UI style for consistency

2. **Test File Naming Convention**
   - All test files prefixed with 'test-' for easy cleanup
   - Prevents interference with real steering documents
   - Allows tests to run in development workspace

3. **Extension Context Access**
   - Modified activate() to return context
   - Enables tests to properly initialize FrameworkManager
   - Maintains backward compatibility

4. **Async Test Pattern**
   - All tests are async to handle VS Code API calls
   - Proper cleanup in teardown
   - Wait for refresh propagation where needed

### Testing Best Practices Applied

- **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Clear test structure
- **Test Isolation:** Each test is independent
- **Cleanup:** All test files removed after tests
- **Edge Cases:** Empty directories, errors, state changes
- **Real Environment:** Tests run in actual VS Code instance
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** All requirements tested

### Next Steps

Task 6.4 is complete. All integration tests for the tree view are implemented and passing. The tree view functionality is fully tested with:
- Unit tests (existing in src/providers/__tests__/steering-tree-provider.test.ts)
- Integration tests (new in src/test/suite/steering-tree-provider.integration.test.ts)

Ready to proceed to Task 7 (Framework updates and versioning) when requested.
