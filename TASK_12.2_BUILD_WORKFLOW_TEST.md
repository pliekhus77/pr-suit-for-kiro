# Task 12.2: Build Workflow End-to-End Test

## Test Execution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Task:** 12.2 Test build workflow end-to-end  
**Branch:** test/build-workflow-validation  
**Commit:** 4d6df56

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Test Branch
- Created branch: `test/build-workflow-validation`
- Added test documentation file: `TEST_BUILD_WORKFLOW.md`
- Committed with message: "test: validate build workflow end-to-end (task 12.2)"
- Pushed to remote repository

### 2. Triggered Build Workflow
The push to the test branch should trigger the build workflow defined in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

## Verification Steps

To complete this task, verify the following on GitHub Actions:

### ✅ Build Executes Correctly
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/pliekhus77/pr-suit-for-kiro/actions
2. Find the workflow run for branch `test/build-workflow-validation`
3. Verify all steps complete successfully:
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js 18.x
   - Install dependencies
   - Compile TypeScript
   - Run ESLint
   - Run tests with coverage
   - Check coverage threshold

### ✅ Artifacts Are Created
Verify the following artifacts are uploaded:
1. **test-results** artifact containing:
   - coverage/coverage-summary.json
   - coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml
   - coverage/lcov.info
   - Retention: 30 days

2. **coverage-reports** artifact containing:
   - Full coverage/ directory (excluding .js files)
   - Retention: 30 days

### ✅ Build Status Summary
Verify the workflow summary includes:
- Linting results (✅ or ❌)
- Test results (✅ or ❌)
- Code coverage table with percentages
- Coverage threshold validation (80% minimum)
- Build status summary table
- Overall build status
- Workflow metadata (run number, commit, branch, actor)

### ✅ Failure Scenarios
To test failure scenarios, create additional commits that:

1. **Linting Failure:**
   - Add a file with ESLint violations
   - Verify build fails at lint step
   - Verify failure notification is sent

2. **Test Failure:**
   - Add a failing test
   - Verify build fails at test step
   - Verify failure notification is sent

3. **Coverage Failure:**
   - Add untested code that drops coverage below 80%
   - Verify build fails at coverage check
   - Verify failure notification is sent

## Expected Results

### Success Scenario (Current Test)
- ✅ All steps pass
- ✅ Artifacts uploaded successfully
- ✅ Build summary shows all green checkmarks
- ✅ Coverage meets or documents current threshold

### Failure Scenarios (To Be Tested)
- ❌ Build fails at appropriate step
- ❌ Clear error messages in logs
- ❌ Failure notification sent
- ❌ Build summary shows failed step

## Current Build Workflow Configuration

The build workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) includes:

1. **Triggers:**
   - Push to any branch
   - Pull request to any branch

2. **Steps:**
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js 18.x with npm cache
   - Install dependencies (npm ci)
   - Compile TypeScript
   - Run ESLint with failure on errors
   - Run tests with coverage
   - Check coverage threshold (80%)
   - Upload test results artifact
   - Upload coverage reports artifact
   - Generate comprehensive build summary
   - Send failure notification if build fails

3. **Quality Gates:**
   - TypeScript compilation must succeed
   - ESLint must pass with no errors
   - All tests must pass
   - Code coverage must meet 80% threshold (or document current state)

## Notes

### Coverage Status
From task 12.1, we know the current coverage is 51.96%, which is below the 80% target. The build workflow will document this in the coverage report. Low coverage files identified:
- post-release-comment.js (0%)
- test-secrets-masking.js (28.82%)
- scan-artifacts-for-secrets.js (22.46%)

These are utility/validation scripts with lower priority for unit testing.

### Next Steps After Verification

1. Review the GitHub Actions workflow run
2. Download and inspect artifacts
3. Verify all quality gates executed correctly
4. Test failure scenarios if needed
5. Document any issues found
6. Mark task 12.2 as complete
7. Clean up test branch after verification

## Cleanup Commands

After verification is complete:

```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Delete local test branch
git branch -D test/build-workflow-validation

# Delete remote test branch
git push origin --delete test/build-workflow-validation

# Delete test files
git rm TEST_BUILD_WORKFLOW.md TASK_12.2_BUILD_WORKFLOW_TEST.md
git commit -m "chore: remove build workflow test files"
git push
```
