# AWS Hosting Strategy

## Purpose
Guide development teams in selecting appropriate AWS services and implementing Well-Architected Framework principles for scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions.

## Key Concepts

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
Apply the six pillars of the Well-Architected Framework:
1. **Operational Excellence** - Run and monitor systems to deliver business value
2. **Security** - Protect information and systems
3. **Reliability** - Recover from failures and meet demand
4. **Performance Efficiency** - Use computing resources efficiently
5. **Cost Optimization** - Avoid unnecessary costs
6. **Sustainability** - Minimize environmental impact

### Service Selection Principles
- **Managed Services First** - Prefer managed services over self-managed infrastructure
- **Serverless When Possible** - Use Lambda, API Gateway, and serverless databases
- **Right-Size Resources** - Match compute and storage to actual needs
- **Multi-AZ Deployment** - Design for high availability across availability zones

## Best Practices

### Compute Services
- **AWS Lambda** for event-driven, short-running functions
- **ECS Fargate** for containerized applications without server management
- **EC2** only when specific instance control is required
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for variable workloads

### Storage and Databases
- **S3** for object storage with appropriate storage classes
- **RDS** for relational databases with Multi-AZ deployment
- **DynamoDB** for NoSQL with on-demand or provisioned capacity
- **ElastiCache** for caching frequently accessed data

### Networking and Security
- **VPC** with public and private subnets
- **Security Groups** as virtual firewalls
- **IAM** with least privilege access
- **CloudFront** for content delivery and DDoS protection

### Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch** for metrics, logs, and alarms
- **X-Ray** for distributed tracing
- **AWS Config** for configuration compliance
- **CloudTrail** for API call auditing

## Implementation Patterns

### Serverless Web Application
```
CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB
                      ↓
                   S3 (static assets)
```

### Microservices Architecture
```
ALB → ECS Fargate Services → RDS/DynamoDB
  ↓
CloudWatch + X-Ray (monitoring)
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
S3 → Lambda → SQS → Lambda → DynamoDB
  ↓
CloudWatch Events (scheduling)
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Approaches
- **Single AZ Deployment** - Creates single points of failure
- **Over-Provisioning** - Paying for unused capacity
- **Monolithic EC2 Instances** - Difficult to scale and maintain
- **Hardcoded Credentials** - Use IAM roles and parameter store
- **No Monitoring** - Deploy without CloudWatch metrics and alarms

### Common Mistakes
- Not using managed services when available
- Ignoring cost optimization opportunities
- Poor security group configurations
- Lack of backup and disaster recovery planning

## Cost Optimization

### Strategies
- **Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant applications
- **S3 Lifecycle Policies** to transition to cheaper storage classes
- **Lambda** to avoid idle server costs
- **CloudWatch** to monitor and optimize resource usage

### Monitoring
- Set up billing alerts and cost budgets
- Use AWS Cost Explorer for usage analysis
- Implement resource tagging for cost allocation
- Regular review of unused resources

## Security Best Practices

### Identity and Access Management
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Implement least privilege access
- Enable MFA for sensitive operations
- Regular access review and rotation

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Use AWS KMS for key management
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Enable versioning for critical data

### Network Security
- Use VPC with proper subnet design
- Implement security groups and NACLs
- Enable VPC Flow Logs
- Use AWS WAF for web application protection

## Compliance and Governance

### AWS Config Rules
- Monitor configuration compliance
- Automated remediation for common issues
- Regular compliance reporting
- Integration with AWS Security Hub

### Disaster Recovery
- Define RTO and RPO requirements
- Implement cross-region backups
- Test disaster recovery procedures
- Document recovery processes

## Summary

AWS hosting strategy focuses on leveraging managed services, implementing Well-Architected principles, and maintaining security and cost optimization. Always prefer serverless and managed services, implement proper monitoring, and design for high availability and disaster recovery.

Key decision points:
- Choose managed services over self-managed infrastructure
- Implement security and monitoring from day one
- Design for scalability and cost optimization
- Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
- Plan for disaster recovery and compliance requirements
