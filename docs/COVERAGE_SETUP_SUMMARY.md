# Coverage Configuration Setup Summary

## Task 20.1: Configure Code Coverage Tools

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: 2025-01-15

## What Was Configured

### 1. Istanbul/NYC Installation

Installed coverage tools:
- `nyc` - Istanbul command line interface
- `@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript` - TypeScript-specific configuration

### 2. Coverage Thresholds in package.json

Updated `jest.config.js` with:
- **Minimum threshold**: 80% for all metrics (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Coverage collection**: Enabled by default
- **Multiple report formats**: text, html, lcov, json, cobertura

Created `.nycrc.json` with:
- Same 80% thresholds
- TypeScript-specific configuration
- Comprehensive reporter list
- Proper include/exclude patterns

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Created `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml`:
- Runs on push and pull requests
- Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Uploads coverage to Codecov and Coveralls
- Archives coverage reports (30-day retention)
- Comments coverage summary on PRs
- Fails build if coverage below 80%

### 4. Coverage Badges

Added to README.md:
- Coveralls badge (real-time coverage)
- Codecov badge (detailed analysis)
- Static coverage badge (80% minimum)

### 5. NPM Scripts

Added to package.json:
```json
{
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  "test:coverage:watch": "jest --coverage --watch",
  "test:coverage:ci": "jest --coverage --ci --maxWorkers=2",
  "coverage:report": "nyc report --reporter=text --reporter=html --reporter=lcov",
  "coverage:check": "nyc check-coverage"
}
```

## Coverage Report Formats

The following formats are generated in the `coverage/` directory:

1. **Text Summary** - Console output
2. **HTML Report** - `coverage/index.html` (interactive)
3. **LCOV** - `coverage/lcov.info` (CI/CD integration)
4. **JSON** - `coverage/coverage-final.json` (machine-readable)
5. **JSON Summary** - `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (aggregated)
6. **Cobertura** - `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml` (Azure DevOps)

## Documentation Created

1. **docs/COVERAGE.md** - Comprehensive coverage documentation
   - Coverage requirements and targets
   - Running coverage reports
   - CI/CD integration details
   - Best practices and anti-patterns
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **.github/badges/coverage-badge.json** - Badge configuration

## Current Coverage Status

As of this configuration:
- **Statements**: 63.66% (target: 80%)
- **Branches**: 54.51% (target: 80%)
- **Functions**: 68.1% (target: 80%)
- **Lines**: 63.16% (target: 80%)

**Note**: Current coverage is below threshold. This is expected as many components still need comprehensive tests. The infrastructure is now in place to track and improve coverage.

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Added coverage scripts and nyc dependency
2. `jest.config.js` - Enhanced coverage configuration
3. `.gitignore` - Added `.nyc_output/` directory
4. `README.md` - Added coverage badges

## Files Created

1. `.nycrc.json` - NYC configuration
2. `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` - CI/CD workflow
3. `.github/badges/coverage-badge.json` - Badge configuration
4. `docs/COVERAGE.md` - Coverage documentation
5. `docs/COVERAGE_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## How to Use

### Local Development

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML report
open coverage/index.html  # macOS
start coverage/index.html # Windows

# Check if coverage meets thresholds
npm run coverage:check
```

### CI/CD

Coverage is automatically checked on:
- Every push to main/develop
- Every pull request
- Build fails if coverage < 80%

### Coverage Services

Once GitHub secrets are configured:
- **Codecov**: https://codecov.io/gh/pliekhus77/pr-suit-for-kiro
- **Coveralls**: https://coveralls.io/github/pliekhus77/pr-suit-for-kiro

## Next Steps

To reach 80% coverage threshold:

1. **Complete Task 13**: Unit test coverage for critical components
   - FileSystemOperations (target: 90%)
   - FrameworkManager (target: 90%)
   - SteeringValidator (target: 85%)
   - TemplateEngine (target: 80%)

2. **Complete Task 14**: Integration test coverage
   - Browse frameworks command
   - Install framework command
   - Update framework command
   - Search framework references

3. **Monitor Coverage**: Review coverage reports after each test implementation

## Configuration Secrets Required

For full CI/CD integration, configure these GitHub secrets:

1. `CODECOV_TOKEN` - From https://codecov.io
2. `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Verification

To verify the configuration:

```bash
# Run coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Check that coverage/ directory exists
ls coverage/

# Verify reports are generated
ls coverage/*.json
ls coverage/*.xml
ls coverage/lcov.info
ls coverage/index.html

# Check thresholds
npm run coverage:check
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Istanbul/nyc installed  
✅ Coverage thresholds configured (80% minimum)  
✅ CI/CD pipeline configured  
✅ Coverage badges added to README  
✅ Multiple report formats generated  
✅ Documentation created  
✅ NPM scripts added  
✅ .gitignore updated
