### 4. Memory Usage with Large Files

**Test: Large file reads**

  - Average time
  - Minimum time
  - Maximum time
  - Standard deviation

## Test Execution

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all file system performance tests
npm test -- --grep "File System Operations Performance"

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- --grep "Directory Scanning Performance"
npm test -- --grep "File Watcher Performance"
npm test -- --grep "Concurrent File Operations"
npm test -- --grep "Memory Usage with Large Files"
npm test -- --grep "Performance Regression Tests"
```

### Test Environment

- **Platform:** Windows (cmd shell)
- **Node.js:** 18+
- **TypeScript:** 5.0+
- **Test Framework:** Mocha (VS Code Extension Test Runner)
- **Temporary Directory:** OS temp directory with unique timestamp

### Cleanup

All tests use temporary directories that are automatically cleaned up after each test run. If cleanup fails, a warning is logged but tests continue.

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Throughput:** Operations per second
2. **Latency:** Time per operation
3. **Memory:** Heap usage increase
4. **Consistency:** Standard deviation across runs

### Performance Degradation Indicators

- Scan time exceeding targets by >20%
- Memory increase exceeding targets by >50%
- Standard deviation exceeding 50% of average
- Operation failures or timeouts

## Optimization Opportunities

### Current Optimizations

1. **Concurrent Operations:** Using Promise.all() for parallel file operations
2. **Efficient Scanning:** Using fs.readdir with withFileTypes for faster directory listing
3. **Pattern Filtering:** Regex-based filtering after directory read
4. **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of ENOENT and other common errors

### Future Optimizations

1. **Streaming:** For very large files, consider streaming instead of loading entire content
2. **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed file metadata
3. **Batching:** Batch small file operations to reduce overhead
4. **Worker Threads:** For CPU-intensive operations on large files
5. **Debouncing:** Debounce file watcher events to reduce processing overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Slow directory scanning:**
- Check for network drives or slow storage
- Verify antivirus isn't scanning files
- Consider reducing file count or using pattern filters

**High memory usage:**
- Ensure files are being released after reading
- Check for memory leaks in file watchers
- Consider streaming for very large files

**Inconsistent performance:**
- Check for background processes affecting I/O
- Verify disk health and available space
- Consider running tests multiple times for baseline
