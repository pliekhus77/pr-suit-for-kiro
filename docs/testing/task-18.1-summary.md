# Task 18.1: Permission and Access Error Tests - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive permission and access error tests for the FileSystemOperations utility class, covering all scenarios specified in the task requirements.

## Test File
- **Location**: `src/utils/__tests__/file-system-permissions.test.ts`
- **Total Tests**: 52 passing tests
- **Test Duration**: ~1.3 seconds

## Test Coverage

### 1. Read-only File Operations (9 tests)
Tests file operations with read-only files and file systems:
- Writing to read-only files (EACCES, EPERM, EROFS)
- Deleting read-only files (EACCES, EPERM)
- Copying to read-only destinations (EACCES, EROFS)
- Reading read-only files (success case)
- Reading files without read permission (EACCES)

### 2. Insufficient Permissions for Directory Operations (7 tests)
Tests directory operations with insufficient permissions:
- Creating directories without permission (EACCES, EPERM, EROFS)
- Creating directories when parent is not writable
- Listing directories without read permission (EACCES, EPERM)
- Checking directory existence without permission (EACCES, EPERM)

### 3. Locked File Operations (8 tests)
Tests operations on files locked by other processes:
- Writing to locked files (EBUSY, EAGAIN)
- Deleting locked files (EBUSY, ETXTBSY)
- Reading exclusively locked files (EBUSY, EAGAIN)
- Copying locked files (source and destination scenarios)

### 4. Network Drive Connectivity Issues (18 tests)
Tests operations on network drives with various connectivity problems:

**Network Timeout Errors (3 tests)**:
- Reading from network drive with timeout (ETIMEDOUT)
- Writing to network drive with timeout (ETIMEDOUT)
- Listing network directory with timeout (ETIMEDOUT)

**Network Unreachable Errors (2 tests)**:
- Network unreachable (ENETUNREACH)
- Creating directory on unreachable network (ENETUNREACH)

**Network Connection Errors (4 tests)**:
- Host is down (EHOSTDOWN)
- Host is unreachable (EHOSTUNREACH)
- Connection refused (ECONNREFUSED)
- Connection reset (ECONNRESET)

**Network Share Errors (3 tests)**:
- Network share not available (ENODEV)
- Invalid network path (ENXIO)
- Too many network redirects (ELOOP)

**Disk Space and Quota Errors (2 tests)**:
- Network drive full (ENOSPC)
- Quota exceeded (EDQUOT)

**Combined Scenarios (4 tests)**:
- Permission denied on network drive
- Locked file on network drive
- Read-only network share
- Network timeout while checking permissions

### 5. Error Recovery and Retry Scenarios (3 tests)
Tests that errors are properly propagated for potential retry logic:
- EAGAIN (resource temporarily unavailable)
- EBUSY (resource busy or locked)
- ETIMEDOUT (connection timed out)

### 6. Platform-Specific Permission Errors (6 tests)

**Windows-specific (3 tests)**:
- Sharing violation (EBUSY)
- Access denied (EPERM)
- Administrator-only paths (EACCES)

**Unix-specific (3 tests)**:
- Permission bits (EACCES)
- Immutable files (EPERM)
- Directory permissions (EACCES)

## Error Codes Tested

### File System Errors
- `EACCES` - Permission denied
- `EPERM` - Operation not permitted
- `EROFS` - Read-only file system
- `EBUSY` - Resource busy or locked
- `EAGAIN` - Resource temporarily unavailable
- `ETXTBSY` - Text file busy (executable in use)

### Network Errors
- `ETIMEDOUT` - Connection timed out
- `ENETUNREACH` - Network is unreachable
- `EHOSTDOWN` - Host is down
- `EHOSTUNREACH` - No route to host
- `ECONNREFUSED` - Connection refused
- `ECONNRESET` - Connection reset by peer
- `ENODEV` - No such device
- `ENXIO` - No such device or address
- `ELOOP` - Too many levels of symbolic links

### Disk Space Errors
- `ENOSPC` - No space left on device
- `EDQUOT` - Disk quota exceeded

## Test Methodology

All tests use Jest with mocked `fs/promises` module to simulate various error conditions:

```typescript
const error = new Error('Permission denied') as NodeJS.ErrnoException;
error.code = 'EACCES';
mockFs.readFile.mockRejectedValue(error);

await expect(fileSystem.readFile('/noperm/file.txt'))
  .rejects.toThrow('Failed to read file /noperm/file.txt: Permission denied');
```

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 7.1**: File operations with read-only files  
✅ **Requirement 7.2**: Directory creation with insufficient permissions  
✅ **Requirement 7.3**: File deletion with locked files  
✅ **Requirement 7.4**: Operations on network drives with connectivity issues  
✅ **Requirement 7.5**: Cross-platform permission handling (Windows/Unix)  
✅ **Requirement 7.6**: Error propagation for retry scenarios  

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       52 passed, 52 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.309 s
```

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all major error scenarios for file system operations
2. **Platform-Specific**: Includes Windows and Unix-specific permission error handling
3. **Network Scenarios**: Extensive coverage of network drive connectivity issues
4. **Error Propagation**: Ensures errors are properly propagated with meaningful messages
5. **Retry Support**: Tests that transient errors (EAGAIN, EBUSY, ETIMEDOUT) are properly exposed

## Integration with Existing Tests

This test file complements the existing `file-system.test.ts` which covers:
- Happy path scenarios
- Basic error handling (ENOENT)
- Edge cases (empty files, special characters)
- Workspace path operations

Together, these test files provide comprehensive coverage of the FileSystemOperations utility class.

## Next Steps

Task 18.1 is complete. The remaining tasks in the error handling suite are:
- Task 18.2: Boundary condition tests
- Task 18.3: Concurrent operation tests
- Task 18.4: Cross-platform compatibility tests

These can be implemented as separate test files following the same pattern.
