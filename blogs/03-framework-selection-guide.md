# Framework Selection Guide: Choosing What Fits

*Published: Week 1, Friday - Foundation Series*

## The Framework Buffet Problem

You know that feeling at a buffet where everything looks good, so you pile your plate high and then can't finish half of it? Framework selection is exactly like that.

I learned this the hard way on our e-commerce project. Saw all these frameworks in SUIT, thought "we're a serious engineering team, we need ALL the best practices," and installed 8 frameworks on day one. 

Two weeks later, our AI was generating code that tried to follow Domain-Driven Design, Clean Architecture, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and microservices patterns... for a simple product catalog feature. It was architecturally "correct" and completely unusable.

## The Reality Check Framework

Before you install anything, ask yourself these questions:

**Team Size Reality Check**:
- Under 5 people? Skip most frameworks. Just talk to each other.
- 5-15 people? Pick 2-3 core frameworks max.
- 15+ people? Now you can consider the full enterprise stack.

**Project Complexity Reality Check**:
- Simple CRUD app? TDD/BDD + Cloud Strategy. That's it.
- Complex business logic? Add Clean Architecture or DDD.
- Multiple teams/services? Now we're talking enterprise architecture.

**Timeline Reality Check**:
- Startup mode (ship fast, iterate)? Maybe just cloud strategy.
- Established product (stability matters)? Full framework stack makes sense.
- Legacy modernization? Start with testing strategy, add others gradually.

## The Starter Pack: What Most Teams Actually Need

After watching teams struggle with framework selection, here's what I recommend for 80% of projects:

### The Essentials (Install These First)
1. **TDD/BDD Testing Strategy** - Because untested code will bite you eventually
2. **Cloud Strategy** (AWS or Azure) - Helps AI make sensible infrastructure choices
3. **Clean Architecture** - Keeps business logic separate from framework concerns

### The Nice-to-Haves (Add Later)
4. **Security Framework** (SABSA) - If you handle sensitive data
5. **DevOps Strategy** - If you're doing continuous deployment
6. **Domain-Driven Design** - If your business logic is genuinely complex

### The Enterprise Add-Ons (Big Teams Only)
7. **Enterprise Architecture** (TOGAF) - Multiple teams, complex integrations
8. **SAFe Framework** - Large organizations with formal processes

## Real Decision Matrix: Our E-Commerce Example

Here's how we actually chose frameworks for our 8-person e-commerce team:

**What We Installed**:
- ✅ TDD/BDD - We got burned by bugs in production before
- ✅ Clean Architecture - Business rules kept leaking into controllers
- ✅ AWS Strategy - We're all-in on AWS, needed consistent service selection
- ✅ SABSA Security - We handle payments, security isn't optional

**What We Skipped**:
- ❌ DDD - Our domain isn't that complex (yet)
- ❌ Enterprise Architecture - We're one team, not 20
- ❌ SAFe - We're agile, not "Agile with a capital A"

**Result**: AI generates code that's well-tested, properly structured, secure, and uses appropriate AWS services. No architectural astronauts, no over-engineering.

## The Common Mistakes I've Seen

**Mistake #1: Framework FOMO**
"Everyone's talking about DDD, we should use it too!" 
Reality: DDD is overkill for most applications. Your e-commerce site probably doesn't need bounded contexts.

**Mistake #2: Cargo Cult Architecture**
"Google uses microservices, so should we!"
Reality: Google has different problems than your 8-person team.

**Mistake #3: All-or-Nothing Thinking**
"If we're not following every best practice, we're doing it wrong."
Reality: Good enough architecture that ships is better than perfect architecture that doesn't.

## How to Choose: The 3-Question Test

For each framework, ask:

1. **Do we have this problem today?** (Not "might we have it someday")
2. **Will this framework solve more problems than it creates?** (Be honest)
3. **Can our team actually follow this consistently?** (Consider your weakest developer)

If any answer is "no," skip it for now. You can always add frameworks later.

## What's Next

Monday we'll dive deep into the TDD/BDD framework - why it's the one framework I recommend to almost every team, and how to use it with AI tools without becoming a testing zealot.

Then we'll look at cloud architecture frameworks and why choosing between AWS and Azure isn't just about technical features.

## Your Turn

What's your framework selection horror story? Ever over-engineered something because it seemed like "best practice"? I'm collecting examples of when frameworks help vs when they hurt.
