# Domain-Driven Design: When Your Business Logic Gets Complex

*Published: Week 3, Wednesday - Architecture & Design Series*

## The Complexity Tipping Point

There's a moment in every project when you realize your business logic has outgrown simple CRUD operations. For our e-commerce team, it happened when we tried to implement the "simple" requirement: "Customers should get loyalty points for purchases, but B2B customers have different rules, and some products don't qualify, and points expire, and..."

Suddenly our clean Product and Order entities were drowning in business rules that didn't quite fit anywhere. We had loyalty logic in the order service, product eligibility rules in the catalog service, and point expiration logic scattered across three different places.

That's when I realized we needed Domain-Driven Design - not because it's trendy, but because our domain was genuinely complex enough to need strategic thinking.

## When DDD Actually Makes Sense

Let me be clear: most applications don't need DDD. If your business logic fits comfortably in a few entities with straightforward relationships, stick with Clean Architecture and call it a day.

DDD makes sense when:
- **Multiple business contexts** that have different rules for the same concepts
- **Complex business workflows** that span multiple entities and services  
- **Domain experts** who speak a different language than developers
- **Evolving requirements** where business rules change frequently

For our e-commerce platform, we had all four. "Customer" meant different things to the catalog team (browsing behavior) vs the loyalty team (point accumulation) vs the billing team (payment methods).

## Real Example: The Customer Problem

**Without DDD** - One bloated Customer entity:
```csharp
public class Customer
{
    // Identity stuff
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    // Catalog context
    public List<string> BrowsingHistory { get; set; }
    public List<string> SearchTerms { get; set; }
    public CustomerSegment Segment { get; set; }
    
    // Loyalty context  
    public int LoyaltyPoints { get; set; }
    public DateTime PointsExpiration { get; set; }
    public LoyaltyTier Tier { get; set; }
    
    // Billing context
    public List<PaymentMethod> PaymentMethods { get; set; }
    public BillingAddress DefaultBillingAddress { get; set; }
    public CreditLimit CreditLimit { get; set; }
    
    // This is getting ridiculous...
    public void AddLoyaltyPoints(int points) { /* complex logic */ }
    public void UpdateBrowsingHistory(string productId) { /* more logic */ }
    public bool CanMakePurchase(decimal amount) { /* even more logic */ }
}
```

**With DDD** - Separate bounded contexts:
```csharp
// Catalog Context
namespace ECommerce.Catalog.Domain
{
    public class Shopper
    {
        public ShopperId Id { get; private set; }
        public BrowsingHistory History { get; private set; }
        public CustomerSegment Segment { get; private set; }
        
        public ProductRecommendations GetRecommendations()
        {
            return _recommendationEngine.Generate(History, Segment);
        }
    }
}

// Loyalty Context
namespace ECommerce.Loyalty.Domain
{
    public class LoyaltyMember
    {
        public MemberId Id { get; private set; }
        public Points CurrentPoints { get; private set; }
        public LoyaltyTier Tier { get; private set; }
        
        public void EarnPoints(PurchaseEvent purchase)
        {
            var points = _pointsCalculator.Calculate(purchase, Tier);
            CurrentPoints = CurrentPoints.Add(points);
            
            // Domain event for other contexts
            DomainEvents.Raise(new PointsEarnedEvent(Id, points));
        }
    }
}

// Billing Context
namespace ECommerce.Billing.Domain
{
    public class BillingAccount
    {
        public AccountId Id { get; private set; }
        public PaymentMethods PaymentMethods { get; private set; }
        public CreditLimit Limit { get; private set; }
        
        public PaymentResult ProcessPayment(Money amount)
        {
            if (!Limit.CanCharge(amount))
                return PaymentResult.InsufficientCredit();
                
            return _paymentProcessor.Charge(PaymentMethods.Primary, amount);
        }
    }
}
```

Each context has its own model of "customer" that makes sense for that domain.

## The Ubiquitous Language Benefit

DDD forces you to use the same language as domain experts. Instead of technical terms like "CustomerEntity" and "OrderProcessor," you use business terms like "Shopper," "LoyaltyMember," and "PurchaseWorkflow."

This isn't just feel-good naming - it means AI-generated code uses business terminology that stakeholders can actually understand and validate.

## How AI Helps with DDD

The DDD framework guides AI to:
- **Identify bounded contexts** based on business capabilities
- **Create proper aggregates** that maintain business invariants
- **Generate domain events** for cross-context communication
- **Use value objects** for business concepts like Money, ProductId, etc.
- **Implement repository patterns** that make sense for each context

Without this guidance, AI tends to create generic CRUD services that ignore domain boundaries.

## Real Implementation: Order Processing

**Traditional approach** - One big order service:
```csharp
public class OrderService
{
    public async Task<Order> CreateOrder(CreateOrderRequest request)
    {
        // Validate inventory
        // Calculate pricing
        // Apply discounts
        // Process payment
        // Update loyalty points
        // Send notifications
        // Update analytics
        // ... 200 lines of mixed concerns
    }
}
```

**DDD approach** - Separate contexts with clear boundaries:
```csharp
// Order Management Context
public class OrderAggregate
{
    public OrderId Id { get; private set; }
    public CustomerId CustomerId { get; private set; }
    public OrderItems Items { get; private set; }
    public OrderStatus Status { get; private set; }
    
    public void PlaceOrder()
    {
        // Business invariants and rules
        if (Items.IsEmpty()) throw new EmptyOrderException();
        if (Status != OrderStatus.Draft) throw new InvalidOrderStateException();
        
        Status = OrderStatus.Placed;
        
        // Raise domain events for other contexts
        DomainEvents.Raise(new OrderPlacedEvent(Id, CustomerId, Items.Total));
    }
}

// Inventory Context handles stock validation
// Pricing Context handles discounts and calculations  
// Payment Context handles billing
// Loyalty Context handles points
// Notification Context handles emails
```

Each context handles its own concerns and communicates through domain events.

## The Framework's Practical Guidance

The DDD framework tells AI:
- **How to identify bounded contexts**: Look for different business capabilities
- **When to create aggregates**: When you need to maintain business invariants
- **How to handle cross-context communication**: Domain events, not direct calls
- **Where to put business logic**: In domain entities and domain services
- **How to model complex business concepts**: Value objects and domain events

## What Our E-Commerce Team Gained

**Clearer Boundaries**: Each team owns their context and can evolve independently
**Better Testing**: Business logic is isolated and easier to test
**Easier Changes**: New loyalty rules don't affect catalog or billing code
**Domain Alignment**: Code structure matches business structure
**AI Consistency**: New features follow established domain patterns

## When DDD Is Overkill

**Simple Domains**: If your business logic is straightforward, DDD adds unnecessary complexity
**Small Teams**: The overhead of multiple contexts might not be worth it
**Tight Coupling Requirements**: If everything really does need to know about everything else
**Prototype Phase**: Early exploration doesn't need perfect domain modeling

Be honest about complexity. Not every e-commerce site needs the same level of domain modeling as Amazon.

## The Learning Curve Reality

DDD has a steep learning curve:
- Understanding bounded contexts and context mapping
- Designing effective aggregates and maintaining invariants
- Implementing domain events and eventual consistency
- Balancing domain purity with practical implementation needs

The framework helps AI generate the right patterns, but the team needs to understand the strategic design decisions.

## Common DDD Mistakes

**Context Confusion**: Mixing concerns from different bounded contexts
**Anemic Aggregates**: Putting all logic in application services instead of domain objects
**Event Overuse**: Creating events for everything instead of just cross-context communication
**Premature Optimization**: Applying DDD patterns before the domain is complex enough to warrant them

## What's Next

Friday we'll explore the C4 Model - how to document these architectural decisions and domain boundaries in diagrams that actually help communicate the system structure instead of just looking impressive in presentations.

Next week we'll dive into technology-specific frameworks, starting with .NET best practices and why the latest language features can actually improve your domain modeling.

## Your Turn

Have you hit the complexity tipping point where simple CRUD isn't enough? What's your biggest challenge with complex business logic - modeling it, testing it, or keeping it maintainable as requirements change?
