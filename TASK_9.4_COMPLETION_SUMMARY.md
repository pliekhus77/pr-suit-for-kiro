## Environment Configuration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Repository-Level Secrets (Simple)

**Best for:** Small teams, single marketplace publisher

**Configuration:**
```
Repository Secrets:
  VSCE_PAT: <marketplace-token>

Environments:
  (none configured)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplest setup (5 minutes)
- ✅ Single secret to manage
- ✅ Works for all environments

**Cons:**
- ❌ No secret isolation
- ❌ No environment protection

### Strategy 2: Environment-Level Secrets (Isolated)

**Best for:** Larger teams, separate staging/production publishers

**Configuration:**
```
Repository Secrets:
  (none)

Environment: staging
  VSCE_PAT: <staging-token>

Environment: production
  VSCE_PAT: <production-token>
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete secret isolation
- ✅ Different tokens per environment
- ✅ Environment protection available

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Multiple secrets to manage

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most teams, balance of simplicity and security

**Configuration:**
```
Repository Secrets:
  VSCE_PAT: <staging-token>

Environment: production
  VSCE_PAT: <production-token>
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple for development/staging
- ✅ Protected production secret
- ✅ Manual approval for production
- ✅ Easy to migrate from Strategy 1

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slightly more complex than Strategy 1

## Setup Instructions Summary

### Minimal Setup (5 Minutes)

1. **Add Repository Secret:**
   ```
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   Name: VSCE_PAT
   Value: <your-marketplace-token>
   ```

2. **Done!** All environments work automatically.

### Full Setup (15 Minutes)

1. **Add Repository Secret** (as above)

2. **Create Production Environment:**
   ```
   Settings → Environments → New environment
   Name: production
   Enable: Required reviewers
   Add: Authorized approvers
   Add secret: VSCE_PAT (production token)
   ```

3. **Update Deploy Workflow:**
   - Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Uncomment environment section:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     name: production
     url: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pragmatic-rhino.pragmatic-rhino-suit
   ```

4. **Commit and push changes**

## Approval Workflow

### Configuration

**Enable Manual Approval:**
1. Create production environment
2. Enable "Required reviewers"
3. Add authorized approvers (2-3 recommended)
4. Configure branch restrictions (main only)

**Approval Process:**
1. Maintainer creates GitHub release
2. Deploy workflow starts and waits
3. Approvers receive notification
4. Approver reviews and approves/rejects
5. Deployment proceeds or cancels

### Approval Criteria

**Approve when:**
- ✅ All quality gates passed
- ✅ Package workflow successful
- ✅ Release notes complete
- ✅ Version number correct
- ✅ Appropriate timing
- ✅ No critical issues

**Reject when:**
- ❌ Quality gates failed
- ❌ Release notes incomplete
- ❌ Inappropriate timing
- ❌ Critical issues discovered

## Testing Procedures

### Test Development Environment

```bash
git checkout -b test/dev-environment
echo "// Test" >> src/extension.ts
git add . && git commit -m "test: verify development environment"
git push origin test/dev-environment
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Build workflow triggers automatically
- ✅ Tests run and pass
- ✅ Coverage report generated

### Test Staging Environment

```bash
git checkout -b test/staging-environment
echo "// Feature" >> src/extension.ts
git add . && git commit -m "feat: test staging environment"
git push origin test/staging-environment
gh pr create --title "Test: Staging" --body "Testing staging"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Version workflow triggers on main push
- ✅ Version bumped (minor)
- ✅ Changelog updated
- ✅ Git tag created
- ✅ Package workflow triggers

### Test Production Environment

```bash
gh release create v1.0.1 --title "Release v1.0.1" --notes "Test release"
```

**Expected (No Approval):**
- ✅ Deploy workflow triggers automatically
- ✅ Published to marketplace

**Expected (With Approval):**
- ✅ Deploy workflow waits for approval
- ✅ Approver receives notification
- ✅ After approval, deployment proceeds

## Migration Guides

### From No Environments to Full Setup

**Phase 1: Add Repository Secret**
1. Add `VSCE_PAT` to repository secrets
2. Test deployment without environments
3. Verify marketplace publishing works

**Phase 2: Add Production Environment**
1. Create production environment
2. Enable required reviewers
3. Add production secret
4. Update deploy workflow
5. Test with manual approval

### From Manual Approval to Fully Automated

**Prerequisites:**

## Security Considerations

### Secret Management

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Store secrets in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ Use environment-level secrets for production
- ✅ Rotate secrets every 90 days
- ✅ Limit approvers to trusted maintainers
- ✅ Monitor secret usage in audit logs

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Committing secrets to source control
- ❌ Sharing secrets via email/chat
- ❌ Using same secret across environments
- ❌ Storing secrets in workflow files

### Access Control

**Environment Protection:**
- Required reviewers for production
- Branch restrictions (main only)
- Deployment history tracking
- Audit log monitoring

**Approver Management:**
- 2-3 approvers recommended
- Include people in different time zones
- Document approval criteria
- Train approvers on process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Environment not found** | Verify environment name matches workflow exactly |
| **Secret not available** | Check secret location (repo vs environment) |
| **Approval not working** | Verify required reviewers enabled |
| **Wrong secret used** | Environment secrets override repository secrets |

### Quick Fixes

**Build not running:**
- Check workflow triggers
- Verify branch name
- Check for `[skip ci]` in commit message

**Secret not found:**
- Verify secret name (case-sensitive)
- Check secret location
- Ensure workflow has environment access

**Approval not working:**
- Check environment configuration
- Verify approvers added
- Ensure workflow references environment

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Check Location |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Build Duration** | < 5 min | Actions tab |
| **Deployment Duration** | < 10 min | Actions tab |
| **Success Rate** | ≥ 98% | Actions tab |
| **Approval Time** | < 1 hour | Environment deployments |

### Monitoring Tools

**GitHub Actions:**
- Workflow run history
- Environment deployment history
- Approval audit log
- Secret usage tracking

**VS Code Marketplace:**
- Installation metrics
- User ratings
- Error reports
- Version adoption

## Best Practices

### Setup

- ✅ Start with minimal configuration
- ✅ Test each environment independently
- ✅ Add protection rules gradually
- ✅ Document configuration decisions
- ✅ Train team on approval process

### Security

- ✅ Use environment-level secrets for production
- ✅ Rotate secrets every 90 days
- ✅ Limit approvers to trusted maintainers
- ✅ Enable branch restrictions
- ✅ Monitor audit logs regularly

### Maintenance

- ✅ Review configuration quarterly
- ✅ Update documentation when changes made
- ✅ Test environments after configuration changes
- ✅ Audit approver list regularly
- ✅ Monitor deployment metrics
