# Framework Operations Performance Tests - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive performance benchmarks for framework operations as specified in task 15.2.

## Test File
`src/test/suite/framework-operations-performance.test.ts`

## Performance Targets & Test Coverage

### 1. Framework Installation Performance
**Target: < 1s**

Tests implemented:
- ✅ Single framework installation benchmark
- ✅ Multiple framework installations (sequential)
- ✅ Concurrent framework installations
- ✅ Verification of installation completion

### 2. Tree View Refresh Performance
**Target: < 200ms**

Tests implemented:
- ✅ Baseline refresh with 5 frameworks
- ✅ Refresh with 50 frameworks
- ✅ Refresh with 100 frameworks (stress test, target < 500ms)
- ✅ Multiple consecutive refreshes (caching test)

### 3. Validation Performance
**Target: < 500ms for normal documents**

Tests implemented:
- ✅ Normal document validation (< 500ms)
- ✅ Large document validation (>1MB, target < 1s)
- ✅ Multiple validation runs (consistency test)
- ✅ Concurrent validations

### 4. Large Dataset Performance

Tests implemented:
- ✅ Operations with 100 frameworks in manifest
  - List all frameworks
  - Search frameworks
  - Get framework by ID
- ✅ Operations with 50 installed frameworks
  - Get installed frameworks
  - Check if framework is installed
  - Tree view rendering

### 5. Additional Performance Tests

Tests implemented:
- ✅ Concurrent operations (installations, validations)
- ✅ Memory leak detection
- ✅ Cache effectiveness

## Test Structure

### Helper Functions
- `cleanupTestArtifacts()` - Clean up test files and metadata
- `createTestFrameworks(count)` - Create N test frameworks
- `createLargeDocument()` - Generate >1MB test document
- `createLargeManifest()` - Generate manifest with 100 frameworks
- `restoreOriginalManifest()` - Restore original manifest after tests

### Test Categories

1. **Framework Installation Performance** (3 tests)
   - Single installation
   - Multiple sequential installations
   - Concurrent installations

2. **Tree View Refresh Performance** (4 tests)
   - Baseline (5 frameworks)
   - Medium load (50 frameworks)
   - High load (100 frameworks)
   - Caching effectiveness

3. **Validation Performance** (3 tests)
   - Normal document
   - Large document (>1MB)
   - Multiple validations

4. **Large Dataset Performance** (2 tests)
   - 100 frameworks in manifest
   - 50 installed frameworks

5. **Concurrent Operations** (2 tests)
   - Concurrent installations
   - Concurrent validations

6. **Memory Performance** (1 test)
   - Memory leak detection

## Performance Metrics Collected

For each test, the following metrics are collected and logged:
- **Execution time** (ms)
- **Average time** (for multiple operations)
- **Min/Max times** (for statistical analysis)
- **Memory usage** (before/after operations)
- **Operation counts** (frameworks processed, documents validated, etc.)

## Test Execution

### Compile Tests
```bash
npm run compile-tests
```

### Run Performance Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Or run specific test file:
```bash
node ./out/test/runTest.js --grep "Framework Operations Performance"
```

## Performance Targets Summary

| Operation | Target | Test Coverage |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Framework Installation | < 1s | ✅ Single, Multiple, Concurrent |
| Tree View Refresh | < 200ms | ✅ 5, 50, 100 frameworks |
| Validation (Normal) | < 500ms | ✅ Normal, Multiple runs |
| Validation (Large >1MB) | < 1s | ✅ Large document test |
| 100 Frameworks in Manifest | Reasonable | ✅ List, Search, Get operations |
| 50 Installed Frameworks | Reasonable | ✅ Get, Check, Tree view |

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all specified performance targets
2. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic data sizes and operations
3. **Stress Testing**: Includes tests with 100 frameworks (beyond normal usage)
4. **Concurrency Testing**: Tests concurrent operations to ensure thread safety
5. **Memory Testing**: Detects memory leaks and excessive memory usage
6. **Statistical Analysis**: Collects min/max/average times for consistency
7. **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup after each test to avoid interference

## Integration with Existing Tests

The performance tests integrate seamlessly with existing test infrastructure:
- Uses same test runner (`@vscode/test-electron`)
- Follows same patterns as `activation-performance.test.ts`
- Uses existing services (FrameworkManager, SteeringTreeProvider, SteeringValidator)
- Proper setup/teardown to avoid test interference

## Next Steps

To run these tests as part of CI/CD:
1. Add to test pipeline
2. Set up performance regression detection
3. Monitor trends over time
4. Alert on performance degradation

## Status

✅ **Task 15.2 Complete** - All sub-tasks implemented and verified:
- ✅ Benchmark framework installation (target < 1s)
- ✅ Benchmark tree view refresh (target < 200ms)
- ✅ Benchmark validation execution (target < 500ms)
- ✅ Test with large documents (>1MB) for validation
- ✅ Test with 100 frameworks in manifest
- ✅ Test with 50 installed frameworks in workspace
