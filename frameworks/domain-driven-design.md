# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Overview

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a major software design approach focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

**Created By:** Eric Evans (2003 book: "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software")

**Core Philosophy:** The structure and language of software code should match the business domain.

**Key Principle:** DDD is against having a single unified model; instead it divides large systems into bounded contexts, each with their own model.

---

## Goals of Domain-Driven Design

1. **Place primary focus on the core domain and domain logic**
2. **Base complex designs on a model of the domain**
3. **Initiate creative collaboration between technical and domain experts** to iteratively refine a conceptual model

---

## Three Pillars of DDD

### 1. Ubiquitous Language
### 2. Strategic Design
### 3. Tactical Design

---

## Ubiquitous Language

### Definition
A common language shared by domain experts, users, and developers used throughout the domain model and system requirements.

### Purpose
- Eliminate translation between business and technical terminology
- Ensure everyone speaks the same language
- Reduce misunderstandings
- Make code self-documenting

### Example
**Bad (Technical Language):**
```
class DataRecord {
    void processTransaction() { }
    void updateStatus() { }
}
```

**Good (Ubiquitous Language):**
```
class LoanApplication {
    void acceptOffer() { }
    void withdraw() { }
}
```

### Implementation
- Use domain terms in class names
- Use domain terms in method names
- Use domain terms in variable names
- Use domain terms in documentation
- Use domain terms in conversations

---

## Strategic Design

Strategic design deals with high-level organization and boundaries of the system.

### Bounded Context

**Definition:** A specific boundary within which a domain model is consistent and valid.

**Key Concepts:**
- Each bounded context has its own model
- Same term can mean different things in different contexts
- Explicit boundaries prevent model confusion
- Contexts can be integrated through well-defined interfaces

**Example:**
- **Sales Context:** "Customer" = potential buyer with contact info
- **Support Context:** "Customer" = existing user with support history
- **Billing Context:** "Customer" = account with payment information

### Context Mapping

**Purpose:** Identify and define boundaries between different domains/subdomains and how they interact.

#### Context Mapping Patterns

**1. Partnership**
- Two teams succeed or fail together
- Coordinated planning and joint integration management
- Mutual dependency

**2. Shared Kernel**
- Small subset of domain model shared between teams
- Explicit boundary around shared code
- Changes require coordination
- Keep kernel small

**3. Customer/Supplier Development**
- Clear upstream-downstream relationship
- Downstream team is customer
- Upstream team is supplier
- Negotiated interface

**4. Conformist**
- Downstream conforms to upstream model
- No translation layer
- Simplifies integration
- Used when custom interface unlikely

**5. Anticorruption Layer (ACL)**
- Isolating layer between contexts
- Translates between models
- Protects downstream from upstream changes
- Maintains model integrity

**6. Open-Host Service**
- Protocol/API for subsystem access
- Used when integrating with many others
- Standardized interface
- Well-documented

**7. Published Language**
- Well-documented shared language
- Common medium of communication
- Industry standards (XML, JSON schemas)
- Data interchange formats

**8. Separate Ways**
- No connection between contexts
- Independent solutions
- Duplication acceptable
- Simplicity within small scope

**9. Big Ball of Mud**
- Boundary around existing mess
- No clear structure
- Legacy system pattern
- Isolate to prevent spread

### Subdomains

**Core Domain:**
- Competitive advantage
- Most important to business
- Invest heavily here
- Custom development

**Supporting Subdomain:**
- Necessary but not differentiating
- Moderate investment
- May use off-the-shelf solutions

**Generic Subdomain:**
- Common across industries
- Low investment
- Use existing solutions
- Authentication, logging, etc.

---

## Tactical Design

Tactical design deals with implementation patterns and building blocks.

### Building Blocks

#### 1. Entity

**Definition:** Object defined by its identity, not its attributes.

**Characteristics:**
- Has unique identifier
- Identity persists over time
- Attributes can change
- Equality based on identity

**Example:**
```
class Customer {
    private CustomerId id;  // Identity
    private String name;    // Can change
    private Email email;    // Can change
    
    // Equality based on id, not attributes
}
```

**Real-World Examples:**
- Airline seat (identified by seat number)
- Bank account (identified by account number)
- Person (identified by SSN or ID)

#### 2. Value Object

**Definition:** Immutable object defined by its attributes, not identity.

**Characteristics:**
- No unique identifier
- Immutable (cannot change)
- Equality based on attributes
- Interchangeable

**Example:**
```
class Money {
    private final BigDecimal amount;
    private final Currency currency;
    
    // Immutable - no setters
    // Equality based on amount and currency
}
```

**Real-World Examples:**
- Money ($100 USD)
- Address (123 Main St)
- Date (2025-10-03)
- Email address
- Phone number

#### 3. Aggregate

**Definition:** Cluster of objects bound together by a root entity (aggregate root).

**Characteristics:**
- Has one aggregate root (entity)
- Root controls access to internals
- External objects hold references only to root
- Root ensures consistency
- Transaction boundary

**Example:**
```
class Order {  // Aggregate Root
    private OrderId id;
    private List<OrderLine> lines;  // Internal
    private Money total;
    
    // Only Order can modify OrderLines
    public void addLine(Product product, int quantity) {
        // Validation and consistency checks
        lines.add(new OrderLine(product, quantity));
        recalculateTotal();
    }
}
```

**Real-World Example:**
- Car (aggregate root) contains engine, wheels, brakes
- Driver controls car, not individual wheels
- Car ensures consistency of all parts

#### 4. Repository

**Definition:** Object with methods for retrieving domain objects from storage.

**Characteristics:**
- Abstracts data access
- Returns domain objects
- Hides persistence details
- Collection-like interface

**Example:**
```
interface CustomerRepository {
    Customer findById(CustomerId id);
    List<Customer> findByName(String name);
    void save(Customer customer);
    void delete(Customer customer);
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Separate domain logic from data access
- Enable testing with in-memory implementations
- Provide domain-oriented query interface

#### 5. Factory

**Definition:** Object with methods for creating complex domain objects.

**Characteristics:**
- Encapsulates creation logic
- Ensures valid object creation
- Hides construction complexity
- Returns fully-formed objects

**Example:**
```
class OrderFactory {
    public Order createOrder(Customer customer, 
                            List<Product> products) {
        // Complex creation logic
        // Validation
        // Default values
        return new Order(customer, products);
    }
}
```

#### 6. Service

**Definition:** Operation that doesn't conceptually belong to any object.

**Characteristics:**
- Stateless
- Operates on domain objects
- Coordinates multiple aggregates
- Implements domain logic

**Types:**

**Domain Service:**
```
class TransferService {
    void transfer(Account from, Account to, Money amount) {
        from.withdraw(amount);
        to.deposit(amount);
    }
}
```

**Application Service:**
```
class OrderApplicationService {
    void placeOrder(PlaceOrderCommand command) {
        // Orchestrate domain objects
        // Transaction management
        // Event publishing
    }
}
```

**Infrastructure Service:**
```
class EmailService {
    void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
        // Technical implementation
    }
}
```

---

## Domain Events

### Definition
Something that happened in the past that domain experts care about.

### Types of Events

#### 1. Domain Events

**Characteristics:**
- Restricted to bounded context
- Preserve business logic
- Lighter payloads
- Internal to service

**Example:**
```
class OrderPlaced {
    private OrderId orderId;
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private DateTime occurredAt;
}
```

#### 2. Integration Events

**Characteristics:**
- Communicate across bounded contexts
- Ensure data consistency across system
- Heavier payloads
- Cross-service communication

**Example:**
```
class CustomerRegistered {
    private CustomerId customerId;
    private String name;
    private Email email;
    private Address address;
    private DateTime occurredAt;
    // More attributes for different consumers
}
```

### Event Sourcing

**Definition:** Track entity state by storing events instead of current state.

**Characteristics:**
- Events are immutable
- Complete audit trail
- Can rebuild state from events
- Time travel capabilities

**Example:**
```
// Instead of storing current balance
class Account {
    private Money balance;
}

// Store events
class AccountOpened { }
class MoneyDeposited { Money amount; }
class MoneyWithdrawn { Money amount; }

// Rebuild state by replaying events
```

---

## Related Patterns and Concepts

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Definition:** Separate reading data (queries) from writing data (commands).

**Characteristics:**
- Commands mutate state
- Queries read state without mutation
- Different models for read and write
- Optimized for different purposes

**With DDD:**
- Commands invoke methods on aggregate roots
- Aggregate roots validate and apply commands
- Aggregate roots publish domain events
- Read models updated from events

**Example:**
```
// Command Side
class PlaceOrderCommand {
    CustomerId customerId;
    List<OrderLine> lines;
}

class OrderCommandHandler {
    void handle(PlaceOrderCommand command) {
        Order order = orderFactory.create(command);
        orderRepository.save(order);
    }
}

// Query Side
class OrderQueryService {
    OrderDTO getOrder(OrderId id) {
        // Optimized read model
    }
}
```

### Event Storming

**Definition:** Collaborative workshop technique to discover domain events.

**Process:**
1. Gather stakeholders, domain experts, developers
2. Use color-coded sticky notes
3. Map domain events chronologically
4. Identify commands, aggregates, policies
5. Discover bounded contexts

**Benefits:**
- Shared understanding of domain
- Discover subdomains
- Identify aggregate boundaries
- Uncover business processes
- Find dependencies

**Color Coding:**
- **Orange:** Domain events
- **Blue:** Commands
- **Yellow:** Aggregates
- **Pink:** External systems
- **Purple:** Policies/rules
- **Red:** Issues/questions

## AWS Implementation Guidance

*Based on AWS Well-Architected Framework REL03-BP02: Build services focused on specific business domains and functionality*

### AWS Well-Architected Principles for DDD

**AWS Recommendation:** Domain-driven design (DDD) is the foundational approach of designing and building software around business domains. AWS Well-Architected Framework emphasizes using domain models and bounded context to draw service boundaries along business context boundaries.

**Key Benefits on AWS:**
- **Independent Reliability:** Teams define independent reliability requirements for their services
- **Fault Isolation:** Bounded contexts isolate and encapsulate business logic, allowing teams to better reason about how to handle failures
- **Scalability:** Domain-oriented services execute as one or more processes that don't share state and independently respond to fluctuations in demand

### AWS Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Organizational Anti-Patterns:**
- Teams formed around technical domains (UI/UX, middleware, database) instead of business domains
- Applications spanning domain responsibilities across bounded contexts
- Shared domain dependencies requiring coordinated changes across services
- Service contracts lacking common business language, requiring translation layers

**Risk Level:** AWS rates the risk as **HIGH** when these practices are not established.

### AWS Implementation Steps

**1. Event Storming Workshops**
- Use [AWS Serverless Land Event Storming](https://serverlessland.com/event-driven-architecture/visuals/event-storming) guidance
- Quickly identify events, commands, aggregates, and domains using sticky note format
- Collaborative approach between technical and domain experts

**2. Bounded Context Definition**
- Group entities with similar features and attributes
- Example from AWS documentation:
  - **Amazon.com entities:** package, delivery, schedule, price, discount, currency
  - **Shipping Context:** package, delivery, schedule
  - **Pricing Context:** price, discount, currency

**3. Monolith Decomposition**
- Follow [AWS Prescriptive Guidance for Decomposing Monoliths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/modernization-decomposing-monoliths/welcome.html)
- Use patterns for decomposition by business capability, subdomain, or transaction
- Apply bubble context technique for gradual DDD introduction

**4. Anti-Corruption Layer Implementation**
- Protect newly defined domain models from external influences
- Use service mapping and coordination layers
- Isolate bounded contexts during legacy system integration

### AWS Services for DDD Implementation

**Compute Options:**
- **AWS Serverless:** Focus on domain logic instead of infrastructure management
- **Containers on AWS:** Simplified infrastructure management for domain requirements
- **AWS Lambda:** Ideal for domain services and event handlers

**Data Management:**
- **Purpose-Built Databases:** Match domain requirements to optimal database types
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Event sourcing and CQRS implementations
- **Amazon RDS:** Traditional relational data for complex domain models

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Amazon EventBridge:** Domain event routing and integration
- **Amazon SNS/SQS:** Asynchronous messaging between bounded contexts
- **AWS API Gateway:** Service contracts and API management

---

## CQRS and Event Sourcing on AWS

*Based on AWS Prescriptive Guidance patterns for microservices decomposition*

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) on AWS

**AWS Implementation Pattern:**
- Separate command and query models using different AWS services
- Scale read and write workloads independently
- Optimize for different performance, scalability, and security requirements

**AWS Architecture Components:**
- **Command Side:** AWS Lambda functions for business logic execution
- **Query Side:** Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS read replicas
- **Event Store:** Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Streams
- **Integration:** Amazon EventBridge for cross-service communication

**Example AWS CQRS Implementation:**
```yaml
# Command Side (AWS Lambda)
CommandHandler:
  Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
  Properties:
    Handler: command.handler
    Runtime: python3.9
    Environment:
      Variables:
        COMMAND_TABLE: !Ref CommandTable

# Query Side (DynamoDB)
QueryTable:
  Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
  Properties:
    BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
    StreamSpecification:
      StreamViewType: NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
```

### Event Sourcing on AWS

**AWS Definition:** Store events that result in state changes instead of direct updates to data stores. Microservices replay events from an event store to compute appropriate state.

**AWS Benefits:**
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of all state changes
- **Scalability:** Independent scaling of event processing
- **Resilience:** Rebuild state from events during failures
- **Integration:** Event-driven communication between bounded contexts

**AWS Implementation Stack:**
- **Event Store:** Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Streams
- **Event Processing:** AWS Lambda triggered by streams
- **Event Routing:** Amazon EventBridge for cross-service events
- **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch for event processing metrics

**Event Sourcing Pattern on AWS:**
```python
# AWS Lambda Event Handler
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('EventStore')
    
    # Store domain event
    event_record = {
        'aggregateId': event['aggregateId'],
        'eventType': event['eventType'],
        'eventData': json.dumps(event['data']),
        'timestamp': event['timestamp'],
        'version': event['version']
    }
    
    table.put_item(Item=event_record)
    
    # Publish to EventBridge for other bounded contexts
    eventbridge = boto3.client('events')
    eventbridge.put_events(
        Entries=[{
            'Source': 'domain.aggregate',
            'DetailType': event['eventType'],
            'Detail': json.dumps(event['data'])
        }]
    )
```

### AWS CQRS + Event Sourcing Benefits

**Performance Optimization:**
- Command and query models optimized independently
- Read replicas for query scaling
- Event-driven updates reduce coupling

**Reliability:**
- Event store provides complete audit trail
- Replay capability for system recovery
- Independent failure handling per bounded context

**Scalability:**
- AWS Lambda auto-scaling for event processing
- DynamoDB on-demand scaling for event storage
- EventBridge handles high-throughput event routing

## Hexagonal Architecture Integration

*Based on AWS Prescriptive Guidance for Hexagonal Architecture Pattern*

### Hexagonal Architecture and DDD on AWS

**AWS Definition:** The hexagonal architecture pattern (ports and adapters) creates loosely coupled architectures that isolate business logic from infrastructure code, working especially well with domain-driven design.

**DDD Integration Benefits:**
- Each application component represents a subdomain in DDD
- Hexagonal architectures achieve loose coupling among application components
- Business logic isolation from AWS service implementations
- Technology adaptability without domain logic changes

### AWS Hexagonal Architecture Implementation

**Core Components:**
- **Domain Core:** Pure business logic (no AWS dependencies)
- **Ports:** Interfaces for external communication
- **Adapters:** AWS service implementations
- **Application Services:** Orchestration and transaction management

**AWS Lambda Hexagonal Structure:**
```python
# Domain Core (Pure Business Logic)
class OrderAggregate:
    def __init__(self, order_id: str):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.status = "PENDING"
    
    def approve_order(self):
        if self.status == "PENDING":
            self.status = "APPROVED"
            return OrderApprovedEvent(self.order_id)

# Port (Interface)
class OrderRepository:
    def save(self, order: OrderAggregate) -> None:
        pass
    
    def find_by_id(self, order_id: str) -> OrderAggregate:
        pass

# Adapter (AWS Implementation)
class DynamoDBOrderRepository(OrderRepository):
    def __init__(self):
        self.dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
        self.table = self.dynamodb.Table('Orders')
    
    def save(self, order: OrderAggregate) -> None:
        self.table.put_item(Item={
            'orderId': order.order_id,
            'status': order.status
        })

# Application Service (AWS Lambda Handler)
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Dependency injection
    repository = DynamoDBOrderRepository()
    
    # Business logic execution
    order = repository.find_by_id(event['orderId'])
    domain_event = order.approve_order()
    repository.save(order)
    
    # Event publishing
    publish_domain_event(domain_event)
```

## Conclusion

Domain-Driven Design is a powerful approach for tackling complexity in software systems with rich business logic. By focusing on the domain, establishing a ubiquitous language, and carefully modeling bounded contexts and aggregates, DDD helps create software that truly reflects and serves business needs.

However, DDD is not a silver bullet. It requires significant investment in collaboration with domain experts, discipline in maintaining boundaries and encapsulation, and is most valuable for complex domains where the model provides clear benefits. For simple CRUD applications or technical systems, simpler approaches may be more appropriate.

When applied appropriately with AWS services, DDD leads to more maintainable, flexible, and business-aligned software that can evolve with changing requirements while maintaining a clear structure and shared understanding across technical and business teams. The combination of DDD principles with AWS's cloud-native services provides a robust foundation for building scalable, resilient, and domain-focused applications.

**AWS Integration Benefits:**
The AWS Well-Architected Framework explicitly recommends DDD as the foundational approach for building domain-focused microservices. AWS provides comprehensive tooling for implementing DDD patterns including CQRS, event sourcing, and hexagonal architecture through services like Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and API Gateway.

**Key AWS Advantages for DDD:**
- **Serverless Focus:** AWS Lambda allows teams to focus on domain logic rather than infrastructure
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Native support for domain events through EventBridge and DynamoDB Streams  
- **Independent Scaling:** Services can scale based on domain-specific requirements
- **Purpose-Built Databases:** Match domain needs to optimal database types
- **Monitoring and Observability:** Built-in tools for tracking domain metrics and system health
