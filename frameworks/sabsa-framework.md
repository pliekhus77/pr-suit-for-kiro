# SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)

## Overview

SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) is a model and methodology for developing a risk-driven enterprise information security architecture and service management to support critical business processes.

**Key Facts:**
- Developed independently from Zachman Framework but has similar structure
- Focus: Enterprise security architecture
- Approach: Risk-driven and business-driven
- Scope: Both IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) environments
- Primary Book: "Enterprise Security Architecture: A Business-Driven Approach" by John Sherwood, Andrew Clark, David Lynas (2004)

**Primary Characteristic:** Everything must be derived from an analysis of business requirements for security, especially where security enables new business opportunities.

---

## Core Philosophy

### Business-Driven Security

SABSA's fundamental principle is that security architecture must:
- Start with business requirements
- Enable business opportunities (not just protect)
- Create traceability from business needs to implementation
- Be specific to the enterprise
- Support critical business processes

### Risk-Driven Approach

- Security decisions based on business risk analysis
- Prioritization aligned with business impact
- Continuous risk assessment throughout lifecycle
- Balance security investment with business value

---

## SABSA Lifecycle

The process creates a **chain of traceability** through five phases:

### 1. Business Requirements Analysis
- Analyze business requirements for security at the outset
- Identify security as business enabler
- Define business mandate

### 2. Strategy and Concept
- Develop security strategy
- Create conceptual architecture
- Define control objectives

### 3. Design
- Logical services architecture
- Physical infrastructure architecture
- Security mechanisms

### 4. Implementation
- Component architecture
- Technology and product selection
- Deployment

### 5. Manage and Measure
- Ongoing operations
- Performance measurement
- Continuous improvement
- Operational risk management

**Key Benefit:** Chain of traceability ensures business mandate is preserved throughout the lifecycle.

## SABSA Matrix

The SABSA Matrix is a 6x6 grid similar to Zachman Framework, organizing security architecture across two dimensions:

### Six Columns (Interrogatives)

1. **Assets (What)** - What needs to be secured?
2. **Motivation (Why)** - Why does it need security?
3. **Process (How)** - How will security be provided?
4. **People (Who)** - Who is involved?
5. **Location (Where)** - Where is security needed?
6. **Time (When)** - When are security controls active?

### Six Rows (Abstraction Layers)

1. **Contextual** - Business view
2. **Conceptual** - Architect's view
3. **Logical** - Designer's view
4. **Physical** - Builder's view
5. **Component** - Tradesman's view
6. **Operational** - Facilities manager's view

## Conclusion

SABSA provides a comprehensive, business-driven approach to enterprise security architecture. Its risk-based methodology and matrix structure ensure that security investments are aligned with business needs and that all aspects of security are addressed systematically. While similar in structure to Zachman, SABSA is specifically focused on security architecture, making it particularly valuable for organizations where security is a critical business concern.

The framework's emphasis on traceability from business requirements through implementation ensures that security is not just a technical concern but a strategic business enabler. This makes SABSA especially relevant for regulated industries, critical infrastructure, and organizations where security directly impacts business success.

## Modern Applications and Evolution

### Cloud Security Architecture

**SABSA in Cloud Environments**

The SABSA framework adapts well to cloud architectures by maintaining its business-driven approach while addressing cloud-specific security concerns:

**Contextual Layer (Cloud Business View)**
```
What: Cloud business assets and data
Why: Cloud-specific business risks (vendor lock-in, data sovereignty)
How: Cloud adoption strategy and governance
Who: Cloud stakeholders and shared responsibility model
Where: Multi-cloud, hybrid, edge locations
When: Cloud migration timeline and service availability
```

**Conceptual Layer (Cloud Architect View)**
```
What: Cloud security attributes (elasticity, multi-tenancy)
Why: Cloud control objectives (data protection, compliance)
How: Cloud security strategy (defense in depth, zero trust)
Who: Cloud security entities (CSP, customer, third parties)
Where: Cloud security domains (public, private, hybrid)
When: Cloud security lifecycle (provision, operate, decommission)
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```yaml
# Cloud Security Architecture Mapping
Business_Requirements:
  - Data_Residency: "Customer data must remain in EU"
  - Availability: "99.9% uptime SLA required"
  - Compliance: "GDPR, SOX compliance mandatory"

Control_Objectives:
  - Geographic_Controls: "Implement data location controls"
  - Resilience_Controls: "Multi-AZ deployment required"
  - Privacy_Controls: "Data encryption and access controls"

Security_Services:
  - Identity_Management: "Federated SSO with MFA"
  - Data_Protection: "Encryption at rest and in transit"

  - Monitoring: "CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub"
```

### DevSecOps Integration

**SABSA-Driven DevSecOps**

Applying SABSA principles to DevSecOps ensures security is built into the development lifecycle:

**Security Requirements Traceability**
```
Business Need → Security Requirement → Control → Implementation → Validation

Example:
Customer Trust → Data Protection → Encryption → TLS 1.3 → Automated Testing
```

**DevSecOps SABSA Matrix Application:**
```yaml

## Updated Conclusion

SABSA remains highly relevant in today's complex security landscape, providing a structured approach to enterprise security architecture that maintains business alignment while addressing modern challenges. The framework's business-driven methodology ensures that security investments deliver measurable business value, making it particularly valuable for organizations undergoing digital transformation.

The integration of SABSA with modern approaches like DevSecOps, zero trust architecture, and cloud security demonstrates its adaptability and continued relevance. As organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats and complex regulatory requirements, SABSA's systematic approach to security architecture provides the rigor and traceability needed for effective security governance.

The framework's emphasis on risk-based decision making and business enablement positions security as a strategic business function rather than just a cost center. This perspective is essential as organizations seek to leverage security as a competitive advantage and business differentiator in an increasingly digital world.

For organizations implementing SABSA, the key to success lies in maintaining the business focus while adapting the methodology to modern technology paradigms and organizational structures. The framework's flexibility allows for this adaptation while preserving the core principles that make it effective for enterprise security architecture.
