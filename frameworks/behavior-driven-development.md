# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

## Overview

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that involves naming software tests using domain language to describe the behavior of the code.

**Key Concept:** BDD uses a domain-specific language (DSL) with natural-language constructs (English-like sentences) to express behavior and expected outcomes.

**Relationship to TDD:** BDD is considered a refinement of Test-Driven Development (TDD), combining TDD techniques with ideas from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and object-oriented analysis.

**Primary Goal:** Encourage collaboration among developers, QA experts, and customer representatives through shared understanding of application behavior.

## Origins and Evolution

**Created by:** Dan North (2003) as an evolution of Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Key Influences:**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Ubiquitous language and domain modeling
- **Agile methodologies** - Collaboration and customer involvement

**Core Innovation:** North introduced the "Given-When-Then" format to make tests more readable and business-focused, addressing TDD's limitation of technical language barriers.

## AWS Integration and Best Practices

**Source:** AWS Well-Architected DevOps Guidance recommends BDD for acceptance testing:

*"Ideally, teams practice Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to define how the system will be designed to be tested before code is written."* â€” AWS DevOps Guidance

**AWS BDD Implementation:**
- **End-to-End Testing:** Use BDD to validate integrated components and user flows
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Define system behavior from end-user perspective
- **Production-like Testing:** Evaluate functional behavior in AWS test environments

**Recommended AWS Tools:**
- **AWS Device Farm** - Mobile application testing
- **Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics** - Continuous user behavior simulation
- **Selenium on AWS** - Web application testing

## BDD vs TDD

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- Focuses on **how** the system works
- Developer-centric
- Technical language
- Unit test focused
- Tests implementation

### BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
- Focuses on **what** the system does
- Business-centric
- Natural language
- Behavior focused
- Tests outcomes

### BDD as TDD Evolution

BDD makes more specific choices than TDD:
- **Where to start** in the process
- **What to test** and what not to test
- **How much to test** in one go
- **What to call** the tests
- **How to understand** why a test fails

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Outside-In Development

**Concept:** Start with business requirements (outside) and work inward to implementation.

**Process:**
1. Define desired behavior from business perspective
2. Specify behavior in business terms
3. Implement to satisfy behavior
4. Verify behavior is achieved

### 2. Ubiquitous Language

**Borrowed from Domain-Driven Design**

**Definition:** A semi-formal language shared by all team members - developers and non-technical personnel.

**Purpose:**
- Common means of discussing the domain
- Reduces communication breakdowns
- Creates shared understanding
- Enables reasoning about specifications

**Benefits:**
- Developers understand business needs
- Business understands technical constraints
- QA understands both perspectives
- Reduces misunderstandings

### 3. Behavioral Specifications

**Focus:** Specify behavior in terms of business value, not technical implementation.

**Format:** User stories with explicit scenarios

**Structure:**
- Title
- Narrative (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance Criteria (Given... When... Then...)

---

## The Gherkin Language

### Structure

Gherkin is the most common format for BDD specifications.

#### User Story Format

**Title:** Explicit, descriptive title

**Narrative:**
```gherkin
As a [role/actor/stakeholder]
I want [feature/capability]
So that [benefit/value]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Scenario: [Scenario name]
  Given [initial context]
  And [more context]
  When [event occurs]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [more outcomes]
```

### Example: Shopping Cart

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart Total Calculation
  As a customer
  I want the shopping cart to calculate the total price
  So that I know how much I will be charged

  Scenario: Calculate total for multiple items
    Given a shopping cart
    And I have added a book priced at $10
    And I have added a pen priced at $2
    When I view the cart total
    Then the total should be $12

  Scenario: Apply discount code
    Given a shopping cart with items totaling $100
    And I have a discount code for 10% off
    When I apply the discount code
    Then the total should be $90
    And the discount should be shown as $10

  Scenario: Empty cart shows zero
    Given an empty shopping cart
    When I view the cart total
    Then the total should be $0
```

### Gherkin Keywords

**Feature:** High-level description of functionality

**Scenario:** Specific example of behavior

**Given:** Preconditions/initial context
- Sets up the state
- Arranges test data
- Prepares the system

**When:** Action/event that triggers behavior
- User action
- System event
- Time-based trigger

**Then:** Expected outcome/result
- Assertions
- Verifications
- Expected state

**And/But:** Additional steps (same meaning as previous keyword)

**Background:** Common steps for all scenarios in a feature

**Scenario Outline:** Template for multiple similar scenarios

**Examples:** Data table for scenario outline

### AWS-Specific BDD Implementation

**Based on AWS DevOps Guidance for Acceptance Testing:**

#### End-to-End Testing with BDD
```gherkin
@aws @e2e
Feature: User Registration Service
  As a new user
  I want to register for an account
  So that I can access the application

  Background:
    Given the AWS test environment is available
    And the user database is clean

  Scenario: Successful user registration
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I submit valid registration details
    Then my account should be created in DynamoDB
    And I should receive a confirmation email via SES
    And I should be redirected to the welcome page
```

#### Synthetic Testing Scenarios
```gherkin
@synthetic @monitoring
Feature: Application Health Monitoring
  As a system administrator
  I want to continuously monitor application health
  So that I can detect issues before users do

  Scenario: API endpoint availability
    Given the application is deployed to production
    When I make a health check request every 5 minutes
    Then the response time should be under 2 seconds
    And the response status should be 200 OK
    And CloudWatch metrics should be updated
```

#### User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Format
```gherkin
@uat @business-critical
Feature: Payment Processing
  As a customer
  I want to make secure payments
  So that I can complete my purchases

  Scenario: Credit card payment validation
    Given I have items in my shopping cart
    And I have a valid credit card
    When I proceed to checkout
    And I enter my payment details
    Then the payment should be processed securely
    And I should receive an order confirmation
    And the transaction should be logged for audit
```

**AWS Testing Tools Integration:**
- **AWS Device Farm:** Mobile app BDD testing
- **CloudWatch Synthetics:** Continuous BDD scenario execution
- **AWS CodeBuild:** BDD test execution in CI/CD pipelines

---

## Declarative vs Imperative Style

### Imperative (Avoid)

**Focuses on HOW - UI interactions:**

```gherkin
Scenario: User logs in
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter "user@example.com" in the email field
  And I enter "password123" in the password field
  And I click the "Login" button
  Then I should see "Welcome" on the page
```

**Problems:**
- Brittle (breaks when UI changes)
- Hard to read
- Mixes behavior with implementation
- Not business-focused

### Declarative (Preferred)

**Focuses on WHAT - Business behavior:**

```gherkin
Scenario: User logs in
  Given I am a registered user
  When I log in with valid credentials
  Then I should be on my dashboard
  And I should see a welcome message
```

**Benefits:**
- Resilient to UI changes
- Easy to read
- Business-focused
- Implementation-independent

## The Three Amigos

### Overview

**Also Known As:** Specification Workshop

**Purpose:** Collaborative meeting to discuss requirements and identify missing specifications.

### The Three Roles

#### 1. Business (Product Owner)

**Responsibility:**
- Define the problem
- Explain business value
- Provide context
- Clarify requirements

**NOT Responsible For:**

- How to build it

#### 2. Development (Developers)

**Responsibility:**
- Suggest ways to solve the problem
- Identify technical constraints
- Propose solutions
- Estimate effort

**Focus:**
- How to implement

---

## Story-Based vs Specification-Based BDD

### Story-Based BDD

**Focus:** User stories and business behavior

**Format:** Given-When-Then scenarios

**Audience:** Business stakeholders, developers, QA

**Example:**
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to log in securely
  So that I can access my account

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am a registered user
    When I log in with valid credentials
    Then I should be authenticated
```

**Tools:** Cucumber, SpecFlow, Behat, JBehave

### Specification-Based BDD

**Focus:** Technical specifications and component behavior

**Format:** More technical, unit-level specifications

**Audience:** Developers

**Example:**
```
Specification: Stack
  When a new stack is created
    Then it is empty
  
  When an element is added to the stack
    Then that element is at the top of the stack
  
  When a stack has N elements
    And element E is on top of the stack
    Then a pop operation returns E
    And the new size of the stack is N-1
```

**Tools:** RSpec, Jasmine, Mocha

**Relationship:** Specification-based BDD is seen as a complement to story-based BDD, operating at a lower level.

## BDD Workflow

### Step 1: Write Feature File

```gherkin
Feature: Account Balance
  As an account holder
  I want to check my balance
  So that I know how much money I have

  Scenario: Check balance with sufficient funds
    Given I have $100 in my account
    When I check my balance
    Then I should see $100
```

### Step 2: Run Scenarios (They Fail)

```
Feature: Account Balance
  Scenario: Check balance with sufficient funds
    Given I have $100 in my account  # UNDEFINED
    When I check my balance          # UNDEFINED
    Then I should see $100            # UNDEFINED

1 scenario (1 undefined)
3 steps (3 undefined)
```

### Step 3: Implement Step Definitions

```java
public class AccountSteps {
    private Account account;
    private BigDecimal balance;
    
    @Given("I have ${amount} in my account")
    public void iHaveMoneyInAccount(BigDecimal amount) {
        account = new Account();
        account.deposit(amount);
    }
    
    @When("I check my balance")
    public void iCheckMyBalance() {
        balance = account.getBalance();
    }
    
    @Then("I should see ${amount}")
    public void iShouldSeeAmount(BigDecimal amount) {
        assertEquals(amount, balance);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Production Code

```java
public class Account {
    private BigDecimal balance = BigDecimal.ZERO;
    
    public void deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
        balance = balance.add(amount);
    }
    
    public BigDecimal getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Run Scenarios (They Pass)

```
Feature: Account Balance
  Scenario: Check balance with sufficient funds
    Given I have $100 in my account  # PASSED
    When I check my balance          # PASSED
    Then I should see $100            # PASSED

1 scenario (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)
```

---

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Scenarios

**1. Focus on Behavior, Not Implementation**
- Describe what, not how
- Avoid UI details
- Use business language

**2. Keep Scenarios Independent**
- Each scenario stands alone
- No dependencies between scenarios
- Can run in any order

**3. Use Declarative Style**
- Business-focused
- Implementation-independent
- Resilient to change

**4. One Scenario, One Behavior**
- Test one thing at a time
- Clear purpose
- Easy to understand

**5. Use Background for Common Steps**
```gherkin
Background:
  Given I am logged in as a customer
  And I have items in my cart

Scenario: Apply discount
  When I apply a 10% discount code
  Then the total should be reduced by 10%

Scenario: Remove item
  When I remove an item
  Then the total should be recalculated
```

**6. Use Scenario Outlines for Similar Cases**
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Calculate discount
  Given I have a cart total of $<total>
  When I apply a <discount>% discount
  Then the new total should be $<result>

  Examples:
    | total | discount | result |
    | 100   | 10       | 90     |
    | 50    | 20       | 40     |
    | 200   | 5        | 190    |
```

### Writing Step Definitions

**1. Keep Steps Reusable**
- Generic implementations
- Parameterized
- Composable

**2. Avoid Logic in Steps**
- Delegate to application code
- Steps are thin wrappers
- Business logic in domain

**3. Use Page Objects (for UI)**
- Separate UI interaction
- Maintainable
- Reusable

**4. Handle State Carefully**
- Clean state between scenarios
- Use dependency injection
- Avoid global state

## BDD Anti-Patterns and Common Mistakes

**Based on AWS DevOps Guidance and industry best practices:**

### 1. Implementation-Focused Scenarios
**Anti-pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: User clicks login button
  Given I navigate to "https://app.com/login"
  When I click the element with id "login-btn"
  And I wait for 2 seconds
  Then I should see the dashboard page load
```

**Better approach:**
```gherkin
Scenario: User successfully logs in
  Given I am a registered user
  When I log in with valid credentials
  Then I should access my dashboard
```

### 2. Overly Technical Language
**Anti-pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Database record creation
  Given the user table is empty
  When I execute INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John', 'john@test.com')
  Then the database should contain 1 record
```

**Better approach:**
```gherkin
Scenario: New user registration
  Given no users exist in the system
  When I register a new user account
  Then the user should be stored in the system
```

### 3. Scenario Interdependence
**Anti-pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Create user account
  When I create a user "John"
  Then the user should exist

Scenario: User can login (depends on previous scenario)
  Given user "John" exists
  When I login as "John"
  Then I should be authenticated
```

**Better approach:**
```gherkin
Background:
  Given a user "John" exists in the system

Scenario: User can login
  When I login as "John"
  Then I should be authenticated
```

### 4. Vague or Ambiguous Steps
**Anti-pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Something happens
  Given some initial state
  When something occurs
  Then something should happen
```

**Better approach:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Customer receives order confirmation
  Given I have completed a purchase
  When the payment is processed successfully
  Then I should receive an email confirmation within 5 minutes
```

### 5. Testing Implementation Details
**Anti-pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: API returns correct JSON structure
  When I call GET /api/users/1
  Then the response should have status 200
  And the JSON should contain field "user.profile.firstName"
```

**Better approach:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Customer views their profile information
  Given I am logged in as a customer
  When I view my profile
  Then I should see my personal information displayed
```

## Conclusion

Behavior-Driven Development extends Test-Driven Development by emphasizing collaboration, shared understanding, and business-focused specifications. By using natural language to describe behavior and involving all stakeholders in defining requirements through concrete examples, BDD helps teams build the right software and build it right.

The use of Gherkin's Given-When-Then format creates executable specifications that serve as both tests and living documentation. The Three Amigos practice ensures that business, development, and testing perspectives are all considered when defining requirements.

However, BDD is not without costs. It requires additional tooling, discipline, and time investment. The scenarios and step definitions need maintenance, and the approach works best when teams are committed to the collaborative process.

BDD is most valuable for complex business logic where stakeholder collaboration is essential and living documentation provides ongoing value. When combined with TDD for unit-level testing and integrated into an agile workflow, BDD can significantly improve communication, reduce defects, and ensure that software delivers real business value.
