# Azure Well-Architected Framework

## Overview

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of quality-driven tenets, architectural decision points, and review tools intended to help solution architects build a technical foundation for their workloads.

**Key Focus:** Design workloads that achieve business value over time by building reliable, secure, and performant systems that maximize the value of investment in Azure infrastructure.

**Key Components:**
- **Pillars** - Core design principles and best practices
- **Workload Guides** - Domain-specific guidance (AI, SaaS, Mission-Critical, etc.)
- **Service Guides** - Azure service-specific recommendations
- **Assessment Tools** - Azure Well-Architected Review
- **Maturity Model** - Five-level incremental adoption approach

---

## The Five Pillars

Unlike AWS (6 pillars), Azure has **5 pillars** with slightly different focus areas:

### 1. Reliability
### 2. Security
### 3. Cost Optimization
### 4. Operational Excellence
### 5. Performance Efficiency

**Note:** Azure doesn't have a separate "Sustainability" pillar like AWS - it's addressed as a workload type instead.

---

## 1. Reliability Pillar

**Definition:** Ensures that the workload meets uptime and recovery targets by building redundancy and resiliency at scale.

### Design Principles

#### 1. Design for Business Requirements
**Focus:** Get clarity on scope, user growth, and promises made to customers and stakeholders

**Key Approaches:**

- Translate business goals into architectural trade-offs
- Prioritize reliability outcomes for each critical user flow
- Anchor design choices around time horizons
- Factor in organizational dependencies

**Benefits:**
- Prevents guesswork and wasted efforts
- Helps stakeholders understand cost/complexity implications
- Shifts from "always up" to practical, achievable expectations
- Addresses near-term needs while planning for future growth

#### 2. Design for Resilience
**Focus:** The workload must continue to operate with full or reduced functionality

**Key Approaches:**
- Distinguish critical path components from degradable ones
- Identify potential failure points and their effects
- Build self-preservation capabilities using design patterns
